            <h2>Dan Aykroyd’s Motorcycle</h2>

            <p class="ad"> A 1971 Harley Davidson Police Special motorcycle is elevated on a black platform.The panels behind the motorcycle read:</p>

            <p>Text written by Dan Aykroyd</p>

            <p>This 1971 Harley Davidson Police Special motorcycle was ridden by me as my principal method of commuting from Ontario, Canada to Manhattan and back during the four years I worked on <u>Saturday Night Live</u>, from 1975-1979.</p>
            <p>The bike was purchased originally by the Ontario Provincial Police where it was used as a component of their Golden Helmets twelve member precision drill riding team. While performing a pyramid display in Europe (where all the riders climb on the back of two teammates riding two motorcycles with one member standing atop the shoulders of the highest man) there was an accident, the pyramid collapsed, and a motor officer was killed.</p>
            <p>Twelve man pyramid motorcycle riding is dangerous.</p>
            <p>My FLH-P, 1200cc, Electra-Glide with solo seat was NOT the bike involved in the fatality, but it was part of the display formation.</p>
            <p>As for the $2,100 I paid to the wholesale broker who bought the bikes at auction and shipped them back from Germany (I picked the lead bike with the turn signals), my money proved to be well spent. The Police Special certified speedometer is worth more to collectors now than the entire motorcycle itself.  (Although the bike’s enshrinement here may add some value.)</p>
            <p>The clock reflects the miles from my commutes in all seasons.</p>
            <p>In September of 1975, on the first ride to my new job at <u>SNL</u>, halfway down southbound I-81 a station wagon with a large family of children slowed down beside me.</p>
            <p>Everyone began waving and smiling at me. Now this is prior to my appearance on TV in the United States, so I wasn’t known. I thought isn’t this a nice welcome to the United States! Then a few other cars and their passengers pulled up beside me and did the same thing. People smiling, waving, and a few pointing and laughing. What are they looking at? So glancing around to myself, the engine, and my cargo, I looked behind my seat to see that the entire rear end of the motorcycle was on FIRE.</p>
            <p>One of my green army surplus canvas saddlebags had been ignited by the exhaust pipe and the contents of the bag (scripts etc.) were now fully aflame. I was sure that an explosion would be next.</p>
            <p>After pulling over quickly to rip the bag away and beat the flame out, a pair of compassionate outlaw bikers pulled over in their van and offered me assistance plus a cold Genesee.</p>
            <p>Getting my kit straight, the trip resumed and at around eleven pm I entered the far right inbound lane of the George Washington Bridge. Halfway across the span all my electrics CUT OUT and the machine went dead. There is no break down lane on the bridge. The problem had happened before. In the 1970s, Harley partnered with the American Machine Foundry Corporation (a manufacturer of bowling alleys) to supply components for motorcycles.</p>
            <p>Harley-AMF bikes were notorious for electrical glitches. But here was not the optimum location for intricate wiring adjustments with all sizes of vehicles swerving and blaring horns in order to avoid hitting my darkened machine and me. In this setting I was compelled to take out my tools, remove the front headlight cowling and secure the wiring.</p>
            <p>Having to do these repairs on the most hazardous traffic spot on earth was a nightmare.</p>
            <p>After about eight tension-filled minutes I got the ‘Electra-Glide’ restarted and gunned it off the bridge into Harlem. People laughed and pointed at me there too as my ride took me in the wrong directions down many one way streets in my desperate search for the lights of Broadway.</p>
            <p>This first ride concluded with my arrival in Greenwich Village near 376 Bleecker Street where John Belushi and his girlfriend Judy lived. John had instructed me to call from a payphone. Seeing a bar with multiple Harleys lined up outside I stopped there and backed in.</p>
            <p>Inside the bar there were other riders. They were similarly attired as myself – black jeans, black denim jackets, black western shirts, leather jackets, Herman boots, and multi-colored handkerchiefs hanging from the right and left pockets of the men’s jeans – yellow, green, light blue or red like mine. You know, for oil checks.</p>
            <p>My arrival was virtually unnoticed. I ordered a beer, and reaching John on the telephone, he quickly informed me that I was in the local hardcore gay biker nightclub. I hung up, finished my beer, and exchanged some Harley talk with a couple of the guys on the sidewalk outside before heading to John’s. Riders are riders everywhere.</p>
            <p>For the first two years of the show I would park the machine in the Associated Press courier slots across from Rock Center. These are long gone. When I wasn’t using it in the city, it sat UNLOCKED outside my high-rise apartment at 80 North Moore Street. Once Tom Davis and I left for a month long tour of South America. Upon returning the bike was still there untouched except for the residue of repeated sprayings on my front rim from dogs.</p>
            <p>In its last New York years this Harley lived on the fourth floor of my loft at 35 Bond Street. It just fit by inches into the freight elevator and sat during the winters in the living room through many great parties.</p>
            <p>I am very pleased that the ride from my SNL years has found such a prestigious and caring home.</p>

            <p>Courtesy of Andy Kaufman Memorial Trust</p>

            <p>Andy Kaufman was a renegade who diverged from mainstream comedy. Beyond his memorable performances on <u>Taxi</u> and <u>Saturday Night Live</u>, Kaufman fully embodied oddball characters like Foreign Man, an uncomfortable, nervous impressionist who could suddenly transform into a spot-on Elvis Presley. Kaufman also seized headlines with outrageous public performances. Among other students, Kaufman challenged women to wrestling matches, and stepped into the ring with professional wrestler Jerry “The King” Lawler.</p>

            <p>A. Letter to Elvis Presley, 1969: Andy Kaufman idolized Elvis Presley and wrote to him while attending Graham Junior College in Boston. In 1929, he traveled (uninvited) to Las Vegas to introduce himself to Elvis.</p>

            <p class="ad"> At the entrance to the hallway, there is a large arrow with blinking lights and the word comedy pointing down the hallway. Moving down the hallway to your right an audience in a dark and small comedy club is staring at you. Around them are quotes from various comedians reading: </p>

            <p>How did a comic genius like George Carlin craft his jokes? What insights and observations inspired his most famous routines? Fortunately for comedy fans, the answers lie within the staggering amount of personal material that the comedian assembled over the course of his 50-year career.</p>

            <p>Carlin meticulously recorded his experiences and reflected on his art and life. He logged notes in diary-like appointment books, diligently filed away ticket stubs and newspaper reviews, and saved annotated drafts of almost every comedy set he performed. For decades, he jotted down pithy observations on hotel stationery and scraps of paper, all of which were thoughtfully catalogued in alphabetized Ziploc bags. Today, this collection beautifully illustrates the constant and careful observation, accumulation, and organization of ideas that formed the bedrock of Carlin’s comedic process.</p>

            <p>Carlin left behind more than 50 boxes of paper material, photographs, and other memorabilia, as well as over 1,000 hours of rare audiovisual footage. Packed into steamer trunks, this extraordinary material came to light shortly after Carlin’s passing in 2008, when five storage units filled with the comedian’s “stuff” were inherited by his daughter, Kelly.</p>

            <p>The George Carlin Collection, acquired by the National Comedy Center in 2016, offers a unique and extraordinarily intimate window into the mind of one of comedy’s most prolific and influential figures. This exclusive glimpse into the collection has been designed to represent, as closely as possible, Carlin’s own extensive efforts to document his life and work.</p>

            <h1>Late Night</h1>

            <p>Late-night talk shows have produced some of comedy’s biggest names, from Carson and Leno to Letterman and Conan. Hundreds of comedians got their big break from an after-hours appearance, and many late-night interviews—whether serious, funny, or just plain bizarre—became front-page news.</p>

            <p>As end-of-day entertainment, late night has provided a reliable mix of crowd-pleasing humor and must-see commentary. With jokes about topics like Watergate and the Iran-Contra scandal, as well as interviews with public figures from JFK to Donald Trump, late night has captured the very history of modern America.</p>

            <h2>Late Night Kicks Off</h2>

            <p>The idea of airing a television show after 11 p.m. was initially rejected as lunacy. Network executives simply did not think anyone would watch TV that late. <u>Broadway Open House</u> was the first program to test the time slot, premiering live on May 29, 1950, from 30 Rockefeller Plaza. To find a studio audience at such an odd hour, NBC wrangled people from the nearby Greyhound bus station.</p>

            <p>Airing five nights a week, <u>Broadway Open House</u> created a demanding workload, and NBC soon hired two comedians, Jerry Lester and Morey Amsterdam, to host on alternate nights. Lester opened each episode by telling jokes, interacting with the studio audience, and bantering with bandleader Milton Delugg. Although the program favored comedy sketches and musical guests over interviews, it established late night’s general template.</p>

            <h2><u>Tonight</u> Finds Its Focus</h2>

            <p>In June 1953, NBC revamped its programming with a new late-night show hosted by former radio comedian Steve Allen. The program debuted as <u>The Knickerbocker Beer Show</u> and was renamed <u>Tonight!</u> in 1954. Only East Coast audiences saw these early episodes, as the technology for broadcasting coast-to-coast did not yet exist.</p>

            <p>During his tenure, Steve Allen made spontaneity a late-night hallmark, confidently wandering into the audience and posing the kind of “Where you folks from?” questions now associated with comedy clubs. In most cases, these impromptu moments earned Allen huge laughs.</p>

            <p>In 1957, NBC unveiled <u>Tonight Starring Jack Paar</u>. Also a former radio comedian, Paar introduced several classic late-night features: a long opening monologue, a sidekick co-host, and a focus on interviews. He was constantly in the news for picking fights with the press, feuding with guests, and criticizing NBC. During an opening monologue in 1960 he quit the program and walked off the show, leaving sidekick Hugh Downs scrambling to cover the remaining airtime. Although Paar soon returned, he left <u>Tonight</u> permanently in 1962, worn down by the demands of hosting a 105-minute program every weeknight.</p>

            <h2>Reign of the King</h2>

            <p>Johnny Carson was still under contract to ABC when he was hired to replace Jack Paar. While waiting for Carson, NBC brought on temporary hosts such as Jerry Lewis, Arlene Francis, Groucho Marx, and a young Merv Griffin. The network was so impressed by Griffin’s natural ease with guests that it hired him as a backup host “in case Johnny didn’t work out.”</p>

            <p>With Carson’s ABC contract finally completed, <u>The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson</u>—and its daytime counterpart, <u>The Merv Griffin Show</u>—premiered on October 1, 1962, broadcasting from NBC’s Studio 6B. It took Carson a full year to find his footing and win over hostile critics, but he eventually developed into a smooth, reliable wit, known for his impish charm and ability to think on his feet.</p>

            <p><u>The Tonight Show</u> hit full stride in the 1970s, establishing its iconic imagery—plaid suits, tricolor backdrop curtain, phantom golf swings—and familiar grace notes: cracks about jokes falling flat, good-natured ribbing about Ed McMahon’s drinking, a constant haze of cigarette smoke. Providing a national platform for countless politicians, celebrities, and comics, Carson was truly “the King of Late Night.”</p>

            <h2>The Network Battles Begin</h2>

            <p>NBC dominated late night for over a decade, with the other networks simply airing old movies or test patterns in the time slot. In 1964, ABC unveiled <u>Tonight</u>’s first actual competitor: <u>The Les Crane Show</u>, starring the provocative former radio host. Crane was soon fired, but when ABC relaunched the program as <u>Nightlife</u> in 1965, he returned with comedian Nipsey Russell—network television’s first Black co-host—at his side.</p>

            <p>A new syndicated version of <u>The Merv Griffin Show</u>, produced by Westinghouse Broadcasting, aired in May 1965 and was scheduled against Carson in several markets. Griffin gave comedians license to do whatever they liked short of cursing, and it’s no coincidence that George Carlin, Richard Pryor, and Lily Tomlin all emerged as bold new voices shortly after their guest appearances on the show.</p>

            <p>In 1967, ABC hired the low-key member of Frank Sinatra’s Rat Pack to host <u>The Joey Bishop Show</u>. When Bishop went to Vietnam to entertain the troops, guest hosts included comedians Don Rickles and Totie Fields. The show’s announcer was a young Regis Philbin.</p>

            <p>August 1969 marked the start of the “late-night wars,” with all three networks airing competing talk shows: Carson on NBC, Bishop on ABC, and yet another version of <u>The Merv Griffin Show</u> on CBS. In order to secure Griffin, CBS had—amazingly—met his demand to receive double Carson’s salary.</p>

            <h2>Early Iconoclasts</h2>

            <p>Airing from 1969 to 1973, <u>The Dick Cavett Show</u> coincided with some of the nation’s most tumultuous moments. While Carson was deliberately apolitical, Cavett jumped into the fray, booking antiwar activists, hippie spokespeople, and controversial figures from both the right and left. As a result, the program remains one of the most important social documents in television history. In late 1973, ABC relegated the show to a once-a-month broadcast that ended in 1975. Many concluded that the Nixon administration was behind the demotion.</p>

            <p>In January 1973, ABC tried out George Carlin as a potential replacement for Cavett. Only the pilot of <u>The George Carlin Show</u> ever aired: Carlin wore his trademark tie-dyed T-shirt and interviewed Shelley Winters, among other guests. The episode tested poorly and ABC dropped the project.</p>

            <h2>Guest Hosts Go Big</h2>

            <p>During the 1970s, <u>The Tonight Show</u> was the most profitable program on television, and Carson wielded incredible power. He demanded higher pay and took longer vacations, opening the door to a series of guest hosts including David Brenner, Betty White, Bob Newhart, David Steinberg, and McLean Stevenson. By the 1980s, the most frequent guest hosts were Garry Shandling, Joan Rivers, and Jay Leno.</p>

            <p>David Letterman was another standby host on <u>The Tonight Show</u>, filling in for Carson nearly 50 times between 1978 and 1981. Impressed with his natural abilities, NBC hired Letterman for a morning talk show beginning in 1980. The early time slot proved inappropriate for his sarcastic wit and <u>The David Letterman Show</u> was soon canceled, but the comedian earned two Emmys for it and developed signature segments such as “Stupid Pet Tricks.”</p>

            <p><u>Late Night with David Letterman</u> premiered in February 1982 and became one of the most influential late-night programs of all time, with a rebellious underground vibe and an art-school sensibility. Stand-up comedians Jonathan Katz, Norm Macdonald, Adam Sandler, and Jon Stewart all got major breaks on the program, which also introduced cult favorites Harvey Pekar, Pee-wee Herman, and Larry “Bud” Melman to a national audience.</p>

            <h2>The Late Show: Rivers to Hall</h2>

            <p><u>The Late Show Starring Joan Rivers</u> debuted on the brand-new Fox television network in October 1986, making Rivers the first woman to helm a network late-night talk show. Although Rivers interviewed Lucille Ball and introduced Chris Rock, the show is perhaps best remembered for the rift it caused between Rivers and Carson. With Fox unavailable in many markets, the program was not widely seen and was canceled in 1987.</p>

            <p>Hired to host the remaining <u>Late Show</u> episodes, Arsenio Hall stunned executives with a massive ratings spike and was offered his own program in 1989. <u>The Arsenio Hall Show</u> was a cultural phenomenon, best remembered for its time capsule trademarks—Hall’s high-top fade, the “Dog Pound” section of the studio audience, and the whooping sound the crowd made as Hall circled his fist in the air. In perhaps the show’s most famous moment, Bill Clinton played the saxophone while campaigning for the presidency.</p>

            <h2>Leno vs. Letterman</h2>

            <p>After 30 years on <u>The Tonight Show</u>, Johnny Carson retired in May 1992, causing seismic shifts in the late-night landscape and kicking off an intense rivalry between Jay Leno and David Letterman. Many assumed that Letterman, as Carson’s protégé, would ascend to the <u>Tonight Show</u> throne. Instead, the crown was passed to Leno, Carson’s frequent guest host. Both the public and the press went wild for<p> behind-the-scenes gossip about the feud.</p>

            <p><u>The Tonight Show with Jay Leno</u> debuted in May 1992. Leno’s lengthy opening monologue, notable for the sheer volume of jokes, was modeled on Bob Hope’s television specials. Recurring segments included “Headlines,” which highlighted moronic newspaper stories from around the country, and “Jaywalking,” in which Leno asked people on the street simple questions and received painfully wrong answers—to great comedic effect.</p>

            <p>In 1993, Letterman shifted networks and time slots to become Leno’s direct competition—not to mention the highest-paid host in late-night history. Airing at 11:30 p.m. on CBS, <u>The Late Show with David Letterman</u> made stars out of local business owners like Rupert Jee of the Hello Deli and featured countless iconic moments in its 22-year run: Drew Barrymore dancing on the desk, Letterman taking over a Taco Bell, a difficult interview with Joaquin Phoenix, and a somber address after 9/11.</p>

            <p>Leno trailed Letterman in the ratings until July 1995, when actor Hugh Grant, just days after being arrested with a prostitute, addressed the scandal on <u>The Tonight Show</u>. Leno’s memorable first question: “What the hell were you thinking?” From that episode until his retirement in 2014, Jay Leno remained at the top of late-night ratings.</p>

            <h2>The Midnight Hour: Conan and Kimmel</h2>

            <p><u>Late Night with Conan O’Brien</u> first aired in September 1993, filling Letterman’s vacant 12:30 a.m. slot at NBC. It was, according to head writer Robert Smigel, “a sketch comedy program disguised as a talk show.” Much of the humor was simply too weird and awkward for veteran critics, who called for the program’s cancellation. The issue wasn’t lack of comic talent—O’Brien had written for both <u>Saturday Night Live</u> and <u>The Simpsons</u>—but lack of on-camera experience.</p>

            <p>Despite the rocky start, O’Brien’s offbeat style spoke to the under-30 set, and recurring characters such as Triumph the Insult Comic Dog and Andy Richter’s Little Sister—played by Amy Poehler—gave the show a unique stamp. In the end, <u>Late Night with Conan O’Brien</u> lasted for 16 years, winning dedicated fans and the respect of the comedy community itself.</p>

            <p>After an eight-month stint hosting <u>The Tonight Show</u>, O’Brien moved to TBS and launched Conan in 2010. The new program was distinguished by extended specials that wittily explored serious issues in places like Armenia, Cuba, and Mexico.</p>

            <p>In 2003, ABC tapped former radio host and Comedy Central regular Jimmy Kimmel for the midnight slot. For years, <u>Jimmy Kimmel Live!</u> struggled to find its footing, but eventually hit its stride with segments such as “This Week in Unnecessary Censorship” and “Mean Tweets,” as well as a running gag about Kimmel’s mock feud with actor Matt Damon. In 2012, Kimmel moved to the 11:35 p.m. time slot to compete directly—and successfully—against Leno and Letterman. The show’s newsworthy moments included an appearance by beleaguered Toronto mayor Rob Ford; comedian Andy Dick’s ejection from the program; and Kimmel’s heartfelt pleas for socialized health care.</p>

            <h2>Expanding the Lineup</h2>

            <p><u>Chelsea Lately</u> premiered in 2007 on the E! channel and became cable TV’s first runaway success in the late-night slot. Along with conducting guest interviews, host Chelsea Handler led a rotating panel of comedians in ridiculing celebrities—a perfect match for E!’s gossipy style. Handler also gave many Los Angeles–based comedians their television debuts, making a concerted effort to showcase little-known female comics such as Natasha Leggero and Whitney Cummings.</p>

            <p>In 2009, two shows brought a small amount of diversity to the late-night lineup. <u>The Wanda Sykes Show</u> lasted only four months on Fox, but was the first late-night talk show hosted by an openly gay woman. On TBS, Mexican American comedian George Lopez became the first Latino to host his own program on English-language television. <u>Lopez Tonight</u> ran for nearly two years.</p>

            <h2>The Late Late Shift</h2>

            <p><u>The Late Late Show</u> on CBS premiered in January 1995. It aired immediately after Letterman and was produced by his company, Worldwide Pants. Over the next decade, the program went through multiple formats and hosts, from legendary broadcaster Tom Snyder to frat-boy sportscaster Craig Kilborn.</p>

            <p>The program finally found its stride in 2005 with comedian Craig Ferguson at the helm. Ferguson affected a devil-may-care style, often ripping up his interview notes to signal that freewheeling entertainment took priority over polished sound bites. In his opening monologues, he often discussed personal experiences rather than delivering topical jokes—a style that harkened back to Jack Paar.</p>

            <p>James Corden replaced Ferguson in 2015, bringing a brisk pace and an emphasis on music to <u>The Late Late Show</u>. “Carpool Karaoke” became its most famous feature, with Corden driving around famous pop stars like Justin Bieber, Miley Cyrus, and Rod Stewart while they sang along to their greatest hits. The short segments lent themselves perfectly to YouTube, and many fans discovered Corden online rather than on television.</p>

            <h2>Politics Takes Center Stage</h2>

            <p>Thanks to the major influence of Jon Stewart and <u>The Daily Show</u>, late night shifted its focus fr</u>om straightforward interviews to comedic political commentary. Although the satirical programs helmed by former <u>Daily Show</u> correspondents Samantha Bee and John Oliver couldn’t be defined as talk shows, they were among the most important programs in the modern late-night landscape.</p>

            <p><u>Late Night with Seth Meyers</u>, which debuted in 2014, brought this new political angle to the late-night talk show. Rather than opening with a standing monologue, Meyers ultimately chose to sit behind a desk, cracking wise about current events as news graphics appeared on-screen. It became a trademark element, combining Meyers’s experience anchoring <u>SNL</u>’s “Weekend Update” with his penchant for fearless political commentary. The segment “Jokes Seth Can’t Tell” also flouted late-night conventions, with two of the show’s female writers—one Black and one gay—flanking Meyers as they spouted punch lines that would be in poor taste if delivered by a straight white man.</p>

            <p>In 2015, Stephen Colbert transitioned from parody to politics by leaving <u>The Colbert Report</u> on Comedy Central to host <u>The Late Show with Stephen Colbert</u> on CBS. The show struggled for a full year as viewers adjusted to Colbert’s new persona as an actual talk-show host, and then the program found its groove during the 2016 presidential campaign. An opening monologue packed with political jokes, relentless mockery of the White House, and interviews with reporters, policy wonks, and politicians distinguished the program.</p>

            <p>One exception to the political trend was Jimmy Fallon, known for delivering lighthearted fare to viewers of all political persuasions. Fallon became host of <u>Late Night</u> in 2009, and despite critics and naysayers, his energy and charm brought in a new, younger audience. Five years later, Fallon inherited <u>The Tonight Show</u>, altering the format to include competitions like “Password” and “Lip Sync Battle.” The program broadcast from Studio 6B in 30 Rockefeller Center, the same studio where Johnny Carson made his <u>Tonight Show</u> debut back in 1962.</p>

            <p>Today, the era of late-night talk shows on network television may be coming to a close, as people watch less traditional television or abandon their TV sets entirely. Netflix programming like Handler’s <u>Chelsea</u> and Letterman’s <u>My Next Guest Needs No Introduction</u> brought late night into the streaming age and made time of day irrelevant for viewers. The future of the format—like a great talk-show guest—is impossible to predict. For now, late night remains a staple of the American experience, providing comedy and controversy well past our bedtimes.</p>

            <h1>Great One-Liners</h1>
            <p>“Brevity is the soul of wit,” wrote Shakespeare in <u>Hamlet</u>. Case in point: the short-but-sweet jokes known as one-liners. Most are no longer than a sentence, but they can still pack a powerful comedic punch. </p>
            <p>Consisting of just two elements—a setup and a punchline—one-liners are deceptively simple. In fact, comedians carefully craft each word of these zingers to engage, tease, surprise, and delight their audience—and above all, leave them laughing.</p>

            <h1>History of an Art Form</h1>
            <p>The story of comedy is one of evolution. Each era has influenced the next, from Greek satire to Shakespeare, vaudeville acts to radio sitcoms, television variety shows to viral videos. Informed by its predecessors, modern comedy reflects the unique sensibilities of our time. It is an ongoing collaboration between past and present, driven by the enduring desire to make people laugh.</p>
            <h2>Ancient Greek Comedy</h2>
            <p>The philosopher Aristotle speculated that comedy originated with the <u>komos</u>, a bawdy celebration involving song, dance, and phallic processions. The very word comedy comes from the Greek <u>komoidia</u>, or “revel song.” Aristotle defined comedy as “the imitation of baser men,” reflecting their errors and vices as a means of illuminating our own.</p>
            <p>Most ancient Greek comedy has been lost to the ages, but 11 plays by Aristophanes survive as the primary examples of the genre. Witty and often outrageous, these works lampoon everyone from politicians to philosophers, suggesting that ancient Greece was the cradle of satire.</p>

            <p>Many of Shakespeare’s comedies—<u>The Tempest</u>, <u>Measure for Measure</u>, The <u>Merchant of Venice</u>—are really tragedies with happy endings. They’re closer in tone to what today’s audiences would call  “dramedy.”</p>
            <p>Yet the Bard’s comic devices, employed in plays such as <u>Twelfth Night</u> and <u>A Midsummer Night’s Dream</u>, have had a lasting influence on the genre. The case of mistaken identity is just one Shakespearean template that has continued to earn laughs in sitcoms and films, from <u>The Great Dictator</u> to <u>The Big Lebowski</u>.</p>
            <p>Modern parodies of Shakespeare include Tom Stoppard’s <u>Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead</u> and the Improvised Shakespeare Company’s stage shows, featuring ad-libbed Elizabethan dialogue.</p>

            <h2>Commedia dell’Arte</h2>
            <p>Originating in Italy, commedia dell’arte was an early form of improvised sketch comedy that flourished from the 16th to 18th centuries. Its expressive characters and stock situations influenced some of Europe’s best-known playwrights, including Molière and Shakespeare, and the style eventually spread across the continent. </p>
            <p>Commedia dell’arte was the <u>Curb Your Enthusiasm</u> of its day. Scenes featured scripted entrances and exits but were otherwise loosely improvised. Because character traits were well established, audiences could anticipate how an actor might respond at any given moment. </p>
            <p>Recurring characters included the masculine soldier whose bravado was obviously false, the well-intentioned klutz who blundered in every situation, and the sad clown who amused others but lived in heartbreak. The word <u>zany</u> is derived from the commedia dell’arte character Zanni, an emotional and foolish practical joker.</p>

            <h2>British Pantomime</h2>
            <p>An offshoot of commedia dell’arte, British pantomime or “panto” still thrives today. This broad form of theater, often based on well-known children’s stories, is traditionally performed during the Christmas season.</p>
            <p>The most famous pantomime character is “the dame”—typically a man playing a matronly, outrageous woman. Drag comedy, popularized by Milton Berle in the 1940s and later by Monty Python, Dame Edna, and the Kids in the Hall, can be traced back to the dame tradition in British pantomime. </p>
            <p>Today, panto productions often involve audience participation, with actors moving through the crowd and sometimes embarrassing patrons by sitting on their laps or commenting on their appearance. </p>

            <h2>Vaudeville</h2>
            <p>A variety show featuring singers, dancers, and comedians, vaudeville boomed at the end of the Civil War. Former slaves had limited career options in the 1860s, and many became traveling performers. With an influx of immigrants into the United States at the end of the 19th century, vaudeville comedy reflected the influence of these new arrivals—as well as anxieties about them.</p>
            <p>By the early 1900s, vaudeville had become big business, with monopolies dominating a handful of theatrical circuits. The Marx Brothers, Fanny Brice, and the comedy duo of George Burns and Gracie Allen all emerged during this period. At the same time, an African American vaudeville circuit, called the Theater Owners Booking Association, provided entertainment for segregated Black audiences. Despite intense racism, breakout stars like Bert Williams succeeded in crossing over from vaudeville to Broadway, performing in revues such as the Ziegfeld Follies.</p>
            <p>As Broadway continued to lure away top talent, vaudeville began its steady decline. By the early ’30s, vaudeville was essentially over, laid to rest by the stock market crash, the ascendance of radio, and the emergence of talking motion pictures.</p>

            <h2>Burlesque</h2>
            <p>Burlesque comedy is frequently confused with vaudeville, which flourished during the same era. Burlesque acts were broader and far more salacious, full of sexual innuendo and double entendres. They were also more predictable, with comedians often performing stock routines in the same way a modern band might cover pop songs. </p>
            <p>Mainstream performers who got their start in burlesque include Abbott and Costello, Phil Silvers, and Red Buttons. Bert Lahr, best known as the Cowardly Lion in <u>The Wizard of Oz</u>, was also a popular burlesque comic. </p>
            <p>Burlesque reached its peak during the 1920s and 1930s, but struggled to survive frequent police raids, with many comedians, dancers, and theater owners arrested on obscenity charges. In later decades, burlesque comedy stuck mainly to nostalgia circuits in locales like Miami Beach. The famed Minsky’s Burlesque sought refuge from the censors by settling in Las Vegas.</p>

            <h2>Literary Humor</h2>
            <p>Established in the 1800s, American literary humor found its most influential figure in Samuel Clemens, writing under the pen name Mark Twain. In <u>How to Tell a Story and Other Essays</u>, Twain wrote, “The humorous story is American, the comic story is English, the witty story is French. The humorous story depends for its effect upon the manner of the telling; the comic story and the witty story upon the matter.” Twain’s manner was irreverent, satirical, realistic—and immensely popular.</p>
            <p>Originally a vaudeville comedian and silent film star, Will Rogers reached his largest audience through the written word. His syndicated column made him America’s most widely read political satirist during the 1920s and early ’30s. As such, he was both praised and scorned. A 1932 letter to a newspaper editor sounds oddly contemporary: “I read Will Rogers, but why does he have to dabble in politics? Let him stay on the funny stuff where he belongs.”</p>
            <p>The Algonquin Round Table of the 1920s was named after the New York hotel where a group of famed writers gathered for lunch. Calling themselves “the Vicious Circle,” this collective of sharp-tongued columnists, humorists, and playwrights included Dorothy Parker, Robert Benchley, George S. Kaufman, and Herman J. Mankiewicz. They remain some of the most influential humor writers of all time. </p>
            <p>Many Algonquin members wrote for the <u>New Yorker</u>, which has showcased humor since its debut in 1925. Frequent contributors S.J. Perelman and James Thurber became the toast of Manhattan, while later writers such as Sarah Vowell, David Rakoff, and David Sedaris earned big laughs as talk show guests. Likewise, stand-up legends Steve Martin and Woody Allen also successfully dabbled as <u>New Yorker</u> humorists.</p>

            <h2>Silent Films</h2>
            <p>Slapstick entered the national consciousness during the silent film era, particularly through the work of film producers Hal Roach and Mack Sennett. These two friendly rivals popularized many beloved comic devices—wild chase sequences, death-defying stunts, pie fights, and pratfalls—often making things up as they went along. </p>
            <p>From their respective studios, Roach and Sennett practically built early Hollywood, turning comedy films into the country’s favorite—and most profitable—form of entertainment. Their combined output introduced the world to Charlie Chaplin, Fatty Arbuckle, Mabel Normand, Laurel and Hardy, the Little Rascals, the Keystone Kops, Buster Keaton, and Harold Lloyd. </p>
            <p>Silent film comedies flourished in the United States from roughly 1915 to the late 1920s, creating America’s first real comedy boom. As slapstick became increasingly popular, other film companies got in on the act. With little knowledge or experience in comedy, these fly-by-night studios overwhelmed the market with their derivative humor and second-rate Charlie Chaplin imitators. The result: America’s first comedy bust. </p>
            <p>At the end of the 1920s, talking motion pictures took over, and East Coast playwrights moved west to write witty dialogue. For silent film comedians, the verbal humor of Mae West and the Marx Brothers spelled the end of an era.</p>

            <h2>Radio</h2>
            <p>Radio became the critical medium for comedy during the 1930s and 1940s, serving as the bridge between the end of vaudeville and the emergence of television. Vaudevillians who brought their comic style to radio included Fred Allen, Jack Benny, Fanny Brice, Bob Hope, and George Burns and Gracie Allen.</p>
            <p>Radio comedy was much tamer than nightclub comedy, thanks to the influence of corporate sponsors. Campbell’s Soup and Lucky Strike cigarettes often had more control over the tone of a program than the comedians themselves, and offending scripts were frequently cut to ribbons.Despite this censorship, notable writers such as Larry Gelbart and Nat Hiken got their start in radio.</p>
            <p>Radio essentially invented the sitcom, with programs like <u>Amos ’n’ Andy</u>, <u>Fibber McGee and Molly</u>, <u>The Great Gildersleeve</u>, and <u>My Favorite Husband</u> dominating the airwaves. The radio sitcom <u>Duffy’s Tavern</u>, which featured a cast of colorful characters sitting around a bar, was created by comedy writer Abe Burrows. His son, James Burrows, later co-created the television sitcom <u>Cheers</u>.</p>
            <p>As television took over in the 1950s, radio listenership dwindled and advertisers shifted their attention to TV. Without the constant scrutiny of sponsors, offbeat radio programs like <u>The Bob & Ray Show</u> and <u>The Stan Freberg Show</u> were able to get on the air. These shows brought satire and absurdity to the final days of network radio comedy—a tone that later influenced <u>National Lampoon</u>, <u>Saturday Night Live</u>, and <u>Late Night with David Letterman</u>. </p>
            <p>The 1970s saw radio comedy revamped with the <u>National Lampoon Radio Hour</u>, a syndicated program featuring future stars Bill Murray, Christopher Guest, Gilda Radner, and Harold Ramis, among others. The show took advantage of loosening social mores and had a snarky, satirical bent. </p>
            <p>On his nationally syndicated morning show, Howard Stern and his cast of characters pushed the limits of acceptability—a provocative stance that continued with Stern’s 2006 move to satellite radio. At the same time, he set the bar for comedy interviews, holding insightful conversations with stars such as Joan Rivers, Don Rickles, and Jerry Seinfeld.</p>

            <h2>Motion Pictures</h2>
            <p>Silent films gave way to talking motion pictures in the late 1920s, and these “talkies” soon made superstars of the Marx Brothers, Mae West, and W.C. Fields. During the financial downturns of the 1940s, it was comedy icons such as Abbott and Costello, Bob Hope, and Red Skelton who kept their respective film studios afloat.</p>
            <p>In the mid-20th century, talented screenwriters Preston Sturges and Billy Wilder began directing their own films, pioneering the writer-director role and wresting creative control from the studios. Sturges became the undisputed master of screwball comedy with films like <u>The Lady Eve</u>, while Wilder provided Hollywood with whip-smart comedies such as <u>Some Like It Hot</u> and <u>The Apartment</u>.</p>
            <p>Peter Sellers invaded American cinema in the 1960s, starring in everything from the <u>Pink Panther</u> detective spoofs to Stanley Kubrick’s satirical <u>Dr. Strangelove</u>. The latter marked a shift in film comedy, from feel-good fare to grim indictments of American culture from writers like Terry Southern, George Axelrod, and Buck Henry.</p>
            <p>Among the most admired practitioners of film comedy in the 1970s were Mel Brooks and Woody Allen, early auteurs whose names alone were enough to open a film. Brooks teamed up with Richard Pryor to write <u>Blazing Saddles</u> shortly before Pryor became a major comedy star.</p>
            <p>Films in the 1980s relied heavily on the talents of cast members from <u>Saturday Night Live</u> and <u>SCTV</u>. Sketch comedy veterans John Candy, Eddie Murphy, Chevy Chase, Bill Murray, and Steve Martin starred in mainstream hits directed by John Landis, John Hughes, Harold Ramis, and Ivan Reitman.</p>
            <p>Together with Jim Abrahams, brothers David and Jerry Zucker created a new genre of deadpan goofiness with <u>Airplane!</u> and <u>The Naked Gun</u>, while director Rob Reiner and his company of players popularized mockumentary humor with <u>This Is Spinal Tap</u> in 1984. </p>
            <p>A new crop of auteurs brought quirky, often dark comedies to the screen in the late ’80s and ’90s, from Wes Anderson’s visually rich Bill Murray vehicles to the Coen brothers classics <u>Raising Arizona</u> and <u>Fargo</u>. At the same time, the Farrelly brothers raised the “gross-out” bar set by <u>Animal House</u>, with hits like <u>Dumb and Dumber</u> and <u>There’s Something About Mary</u> paving the way for raunchy comedies to come.</p>
            <p>In the new millennium, film comedy fully embraced its slapstick roots, with actors Adam Sandler, Will Ferrell, and Sacha Baron Cohen playing outlandish protagonists who fall, fumble, and get hit in the family jewels. Director Judd Apatow brought a sweeter self-deprecation to bro humor in films like <u>The 40-Year-Old Virgin</u> and <u>Knocked Up</u>, while Edgar Wright redefined “bromance” with spoofs such as <u>Shaun of the Dead</u> and <u>Hot Fuzz</u>, both starring Simon Pegg and Nick Frost.</p>
            <p>Within this male-dominated world, female directors also began finding box office success. In 1982, Amy Heckerling directed <u>Fast Times</u> at <u>Ridgemont High</u>, and went on to write and direct <u>Clueless</u>, while Penelope Spheeris helmed <u>Wayne’s World</u> in 1992. Acclaimed screenwriters Nora Ephron and Nancy Meyers also stepped into the director’s chair, with hits like <u>Sleepless in Seattle</u> and <u>Something’s Gotta Give</u>, respectively. Both Sofia Coppola and Greta Gerwig received Best Director Oscar nominations for their comedic films—a sign of potentially widening cracks in Hollywood’s glass ceiling.</p>

            <h2>Comic Strips</h2>
            <p>The impact of comic strips on the tone of modern comedy is often overlooked. <u>Li’l Abner</u> by Al Capp and <u>Pogo</u> by Walt Kelly used hillbillies and swamp creatures as metaphors to address issues like McCarthyism and social protest. Charles Schulz’s <u>Peanuts</u> was a revelation when it debuted in 1950, stunning readers with its themes of alienation, hopelessness, and existential angst. </p>
            <p>Jules Feiffer’s <u>Sick Sick Sick</u> was one of the first comic strips to target an intellectual audience. It was considered part of the “sick comedy” movement that included nightclub comedians Lenny Bruce, Mort Sahl, and Nichols and May. When a new stand-up named Woody Allen burst onto the scene, reviewers said he was “straight out of the Jules Feiffer playbook.”</p>
            <p><u>MAD</u> magazine, which debuted in 1952, showcased the creative anarchy of artists Harvey Kurtzman, Jack Davis, Al Jaffee, and Don Martin, among others. <u>MAD</u> was marketed as a humor magazine for the preteen set, but its counterculture tone informed later cartoonists like Robert Crumb and Gilbert Shelton. Comedians Ernie Kovacs, Henry Morgan, Stan Freberg, and Bob and Ray occasionally contributed to <u>MAD</u>, and many writers on <u>The Simpsons</u> have cited the magazine’s influence.</p>
            <p>The popularity of comic strips peaked in the mid-20th century as Americans gradually turned from newspapers to television news. The enduring exception is political cartooning, from Garry Trudeau’s long-running <u>Doonesbury</u> to Ruben Bolling’s satirical <u>Tom the Dancing Bug</u>, which gained prominence online during the Bush-Cheney years.</p>

            <h2>Stand-Up </h2>
            <p>Though the roots of stand-up stretch back to the days when Mark Twain traveled the world, retelling his stories for money and laughs, stand-up comics truly emerged on the vaudeville stage. Vaudevillian Frank Fay was among the first performers to get laughs simply by talking, without relying on pratfalls, costumes, or props. His style, revolutionary for its time, was emulated by young comedians including Jack Benny, Milton Berle, and Bob Hope.</p>
            <p>After vaudeville houses shuttered during the Great Depression, comics such as Jack Carter, Myron Cohen, Buddy Hackett, and Alan King honed their stand-up skills at resorts in New York’s Catskill Mountains. Many also worked in the Mafia-owned nightclubs of the era, and it’s believed the Mob coined the term “stand-up comic,” meaning a dependable comedian who could stand and deliver one punch line after another. </p>
            <p>Stand-up material remained largely generic and impersonal until the mid-1950s, when Lenny Bruce revolutionized the genre with his provocative first-person monologues. Along with fellow trailblazers Mort Sahl and Jonathan Winters, Bruce paved the way for smart, satirical comics such as Bob Newhart, Shelley Berman, and Dick Gregory. The no-holds-barred honesty of this new “sick comedy” also heavily influenced George Carlin, Richard Pryor, and Lily Tomlin, the defining stand-up comics of the ’60s counterculture generation. </p>
            <p>By the 1970s, stand-up comedians were akin to rock stars, with acts like Steve Martin and Cheech & Chong selling out concert venues and drawing rowdy crowds. Comedy clubs opened across America, from Catch A Rising Star in New York to the Comedy Store in Los Angeles, showcasing future stars Robin Williams, Freddy Prinze, Jay Leno, and David Letterman, among others. </p>
            <p>Stand-up was everywhere in the 1980s—radio, cable TV, even suburban strip malls—and comics Jerry Seinfeld and Bill Cosby spun their success into prime-time television shows. Eddie Murphy, with his raunchy yet charismatic style, was the most popular stand-up comic of the decade, but older comedians such as George Burns, Rodney Dangerfield, and Joan Rivers also reinvented themselves for new audiences. It was a massive comedy boom, but oversaturation spelled its downfall. By the 1990s, hundreds of once-thriving clubs had closed. </p>
            <p>“Alternative comedy” rose from the ashes, led by arty comics who often performed for free at open mic events in bookstores, Laundromats, and other offbeat venues. Among these newcomers were then-unknowns David Cross, Janeane Garofalo, Patton Oswalt, and Sarah Silverman.</p>
            <p>A few tenacious comics from the 1980s, including Jon Stewart, Louis C.K., and Chris Rock, held on and emerged as major players in the early 21st century. Stand-up comedy continued to provide a springboard for film and television careers, launching stars such as Amy Schumer and Pete Holmes. In the era of Netflix, YouTube, and stand-up–obsessed podcasts, the genre has become more accessible than ever.</p>

            <h2>Improv</h2>
            <p>Acting teacher Viola Spolin helped pioneer the techniques of modern American improv in the 1930s, as part of a WPA program designed to teach theater to underprivileged children and recent immigrants. Spolin used what she called “theater games” to help her students focus, react spontaneously, and incorporate their diverse experiences into a collaborative whole. </p>
            <p>In the early 1950s, Spolin’s son, Paul Sills, took his mother’s theater games and developed improvisational comedy, together with David Shepherd, Elaine May, Mike Nichols, Alan Alda, and Shelley Berman. Their Chicago-based improv troupe, the Compass Players, eventually evolved into the legendary Second City.</p>
            <p>Unfamiliar with the techniques of improv, audiences were both baffled and dazzled by Second City’s spontaneous bursts of comic genius. The troupe produced some of America’s best-known comics and later became the primary recruiting ground for sketch programs like <u>Saturday Night Live</u>. Notable Second City alumni include Bill Murray, John Candy, Mike Myers, Stephen Colbert, and Tina Fey.</p>
            <p>New comedy collectives followed Second City’s lead. Among the most successful were the Upright Citizens Brigade, co-founded by Amy Poehler, and the Groundlings, whose early members included Tracy and Laraine Newman. These groups offered classes, training, and a development program for new generations of talent. Once an industry secret, improv techniques went mainstream with the success of television programs like <u>Whose Line Is It Anyway?</u></p>

            <h2>Sketch Comedy</h2>
            <p>For many years, sketch comedy was primarily presented as part of a Broadway revue—a variety show whose songs and sketches followed a theme rather than a story line. Many sketch comedians of the early television era, including Sid Caesar, Jackie Gleason, Imogene Coca, Buddy Hackett, and Carl Reiner, first honed their craft on these shows. In the 1950s, Caesar largely dominated sketch comedy, with help from Reiner, Coca, and a stellar writing team that included Mel Brooks and Neil Simon. Compared to the more cerebral humor of <u>Your Show of Shows</u> and <u>Caesar’s Hour</u>, <u>The Red Skelton Show</u> was viewed as less sophisticated—the very reason, some argue, that Skelton’s program lasted for 20 years.</p>
            <p>In the late 1960s, Carol Burnett became the first woman to host a hit sketch show, with a versatile ensemble that included Tim Conway and Harvey Korman. By contrast, Lorne Michaels envisioned his new program, Saturday Night Live, as the youthful, edgy antithesis to mainstream comedy. From its premiere in 1975, <u>SNL</u> went on to become the most successful sketch show in television history.</p>
            <p>The absurdist humor of <u>Monty Python’s Flying Circus</u> also turned the form on its head, making it easily the most influential sketch program of its day. <u>SNL</u>, <u>SCTV</u>, <u>The Kids in the Hall</u>, <u>Mr. Show</u>, and <u>The State</u> all benefited from the <u>Monty Python</u> influence.</p>
            <p><u>In Living Color</u> ushered in a new era of representation in sketch comedy during the 1990s, showcasing a wide variety of Black talent previously excluded from the genre. The Wayans brothers were its creative force, helping to launch the careers of Jamie Foxx, Jim Carrey, and Jennifer Lopez, while luring comedians like Chris Rock away from <u>SNL</u>.</p>
            <p>With the rise of Comedy Central, programs like <u>Chappelle’s Show</u>, <u>Key and Peele</u>, <u>Kroll Show</u>, and <u>Inside Amy Schumer</u> stood on the shoulders of their predecessors, further evolving the sketch format. </p>

            <h2>Television</h2>
            <p>Early experiments with television broadcasting began in the late 1920s and continued throughout the 1930s with marginal results. Comic actors like Morey Amsterdam and Mary Wickes were used in test broadcasts, but their audience was severely limited, as few people owned television sets at the time.During World War II, commercial television development was halted and the technology was commandeered by the military. When the war ended, restrictions were lifted and television’s first major comedy shows aired. <u>Texaco Star Theatre</u> made Milton Berle a household name in 1948, while <u>Toast of the Town</u> did the same for Ed Sullivan and the many stand-up comedians he presented.</p>

            <p>In 1950, NBC broke into late-night comedy with the variety show <u>Broadway Open House</u>, hosted by comedians Jerry Lester and Morey Amsterdam. In 1954, the network introduced an early version of <u>The Tonight Show</u>, with host Steve Allen. Allen’s successor, Jack Paar, created the classic late-night formula: an opening monologue and a host conducting interviews from behind a desk. Subsequent hosts Johnny Carson, Jay Leno, Conan O’Brien, and Jimmy Fallon continued the pattern. Hosting a late-night show became a goal for many aspiring comedians—one realized by David Letterman, Joan Rivers, and Arsenio Hall, among others. </p>

            <p>Starting in the late 1940s, sitcoms became the cornerstone of television comedy. Along with <u>I Love Lucy</u>, which made Lucille Ball a TV powerhouse, pinnacles of 1950s television included <u>The Honeymooners</u> and <u>The Phil Silvers Show</u>. In the 1960s, <u>The Andy Griffith Show</u> and <u>The Dick Van Dyke Show</u> were highly respected, while the new relevancy of <u>All in the Family</u> and <u>The Mary Tyler Moore Show</u> spoke to the cultural tensions and changing mores of the 1970s.</p>

            <p>Sitcoms largely followed the same template until the mid-’80s, when <u>Moonlighting</u> began playing with form, making it the rare program to meld both traditional and experimental styles. In 1992, <u>The Larry Sanders Show</u>, starring Garry Shandling, introduced the behind-the-scenes style later embraced by <u>The Office</u>, <u>Parks and Recreation</u>, and <u>Modern Family</u>. </p>

            <h2>Animation</h2>
            <p>In 1914, Winsor McCay created one of the earliest American animated cartoons, <u>Gertie the Dinosaur</u>, and toured the vaudeville circuit with it. McCay projected Gertie onto a screen and pretended to command and even feed the dinosaur—a stunt that mystified audiences of the time.</p>
            <p>By the 1920s, cartoons were common in movie theaters. Max Fleischer’s Out of the Inkwell series paved the way for his most successful projects, Betty Boop and Popeye the Sailor, the latter adapted from E.C. Segar’s comic strip. </p>
            <p>Walt Disney became the darling of Hollywood and helped usher in the age of sound with animated cartoons such as <u>Steamboat Willie</u>, Mickey Mouse’s iconic screen debut. Warner Bros. delighted audiences with Bugs Bunny, Porky Pig, Daffy Duck, and other famous characters overseen by animation funnymen Tex Avery, Bob Clampett, Chuck Jones, and Friz Freleng.</p>
            <p>Beginning in 1940, animators William Hanna and Joseph Barbera created <u>Tom and Jerry</u> theatrical shorts for MGM, honing the tricks they later brought with them to television. Their Hanna-Barbera company produced the animated series <u>Top Cat</u>—a satire of the popular <u>Phil Silvers Show</u>—and <u>The Flintstones</u>, which reimagined <u>The Honeymooners</u> in the Stone Age. </p>
            <p>In the late 1950s and early ’60s, Jay Ward hired comedy writers to script subversive material for his Rocky and Bullwinkle cartoon shows. Many of these same writers went on to create hits like <u>Barney Miller</u> and <u>The Mary Tyler Moore Show</u>.</p>
            <p>Animation reached a nadir in the 1970s and ’80s, when it was seen primarily as an uninspired medium for children’s programming. This changed after <u>The Simpsons</u> appeared as a segment on <u>The Tracey Ullman Show</u>, a sketch program on the new Fox television network. <u>The Simpsons</u> spun off into its own series and became an immediate—and controversial—sensation. A spate of adult-oriented animation followed, led by <u>The Ren & Stimpy Show</u>, <u>Beavis and Butt-Head</u>, <u>South Park</u>, <u>Family Guy</u>, and the comedy smorgasbord Adult Swim.</p>
            <p>Feature-length animation underwent a similar renaissance, with Disney’s <u>Aladdin</u> marking a shift toward more sophisticated comedy in 1992. Featuring the manic improvisations of Robin Williams, the film jump-started the trend of comedians voicing animated characters, from Tim Allen as Buzz Lightyear and Ellen DeGeneres as Dory, to Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy as an ogre and a donkey in Shrek.</p>

            <h2>Internet</h2>
            <p>Early internet humor was largely limited to stock jokes that were printed out and passed around the office. When the Wisconsin-based satirical newspaper the <u>Onion</u> took its fake headlines and tongue-in-cheek articles online in 1996, the web had one of its first comedic hits.</p>
            <p>Beginning in the late 1990s, initial forays into online video included Flash animation by <u>Spümcø</u>, the company behind <u>The Ren & Stimpy Show</u>, and the cartoon series <u>Homestar Runner</u>. A Wild West atmosphere prevailed, and lo-fi, sharable memes—from rapping bananas to dancing babies—often became overnight sensations.</p>
            <p>Online comedy didn’t truly take off until video technology was simplified and perfected by YouTube in 2005. Immediately after the website launched, an unauthorized upload of “Lazy Sunday”—a <u>Saturday Night Live</u> sketch by the Lonely Island comedy troupe—went viral, putting both Andy Samberg and YouTube on the map.</p>
            <p>Although acclaimed projects such as Bad Lip Reading and <u>Between Two Ferns</u> were designed specifically for the web, the majority of internet comedy soon grew to resemble traditional television. Netflix and Amazon essentially functioned as online networks, and some TV programs, such as <u>Saturday Night Live</u> and <u>Last Week Tonight with John Oliver</u>, circumvented bootleggers by uploading segments and even full episodes for free.</p>
            <p>Of all internet genres, podcasting has encouraged the most cross-pollination with traditional comedy, attracting both established comics and young upstarts with its low cost, wide reach, and opportunities for creative control. Shows like like <u>WTF with Marc Maron</u>, <u>2 Dope Queens</u>, and <u>Comedy Bang! Bang!</u> have gained fans by combining candid, long-form interviews with sketch and improv routines such as  <u>Nerdist</u>, <u>Earwold</u>, and <u>All Things Comedy</u> have further expanded audiences and amplified revenue, turning podcasting from a n indie art from to a comedy juggernaut.</p>

            <h1>Funny Papers</h1>
            <p>Brad Anderson, the creator of the long-running <u>Marmaduke</u> comic strip, was born in Jamestown, New York, in 1924, and raised in the nearby town of Portland.</p>

            <p>Created by Anderson in 1954, <u>Marmaduke</u> tells the story of a lovable Great Dane and his family, the Winslows. Syndicated for over seven decades, the strip appeared in more than 500 newspapers around the world—and was often based on experiences in Anderson's real life in Chautauqua County.</p> 

            <p>The items exhibited here were gathered from Anderson’s studio and arranged to approximate the experience of looking in on the artist at work. The Sunday page featured on Anderson’s light board shows a Fourth of July scene at Midway State Park, on the shore of Chautauqua Lake. The drawing board was gifted to Anderson by his parents when he was a high school student and used throughout his entire artistic career.</p>

            <h1>Radio Booths</h1>
            <h2>1930s to 1940s: The Golden Age of Radio</h2>

            <p>The 1930s ushered in a golden age on the airwaves, as vaudeville theaters shuttered and radio became the primary medium for comics such as Fred Allen, Bob Hope, and George Burns and Gracie Allen. Their early comedy programs, along with sitcoms like <u>Amos ’n’ Andy</u>, provided a marvelous distraction from the Great Depression—and later, World War II.</p>


            <h2>1950s: Rebels with a Cause</h2>

            <p>The 1950s were a time of transition for radio, as television rose to prominence and began siphoning off talent and audiences. The upside? Wildly inventive comics like Stan Freberg and Bob Elliott and Ray Goulding were able to step into the void, bringing their offbeat sensibilities and subversive humor to the airwaves.</p>


            <h2>1970s: Comedy and the Counterculture</h2>

            <p>FM radio became commercially successful in the early 1970s, with DJs appealing to pot-smoking counterculture types by playing long tracks off rock ’n’ roll LPs. A similar demographic tuned in for the manic satire of <u>The National Lampoon Radio Hour</u>, as well as surreal performances by the Firesign Theatre and Credibility Gap comedy troupes.</p>

            <h2>1980s: Big Hair and Big Names</h2>

            <p>Larger-than- life personalities drove radio comedy in the 1980s. <u>The Dr. Demento Show</u> introduced the antics of “Weird Al” Yankovic, while morning show hosts Don Imus and Howard Stern earned laughs and notoriety with their provocative character sketches and stunts. Major comics such as Don Rickles, Garry Shandling, and Albert Brooks also gave radio interviews, providing new insights into the inner workings of comedy.</p>


            <h2>Late ’90s to Now: Comedians Talk Story</h2>

            <p>In the modern era of radio, comedians are in demand for their insights as much as their jokes. An interview on <u>The Howard Stern Show</u> carries major cachet, while <u>This American Life</u>, with host Ira Glass, has made its mark by airing thoughtful stories from humorists such as David Sedaris, Sarah Vowell, and Dave Eggers.</p>

            <h2>Audio Transcript</h2>
            <h2>1930s to 1940s: The Golden Age of Radio</h2>

            <p>[Narrator] In this 1948 clip from <u>The Fred Allen Show</u>, Allen and his wife, Portland Hoffa, take a stroll down main street—and come across some interesting characters.</p>

            <p>[Fred Allen]  Say, here's an item for them. Look at this, it says radio comedy is suffering from monotony, undernourishment and repetition.</p>
            <p>[Portland Hoffa]  I wonder how people feel about radio comedy.</p>
            <p>[Fred Allen]  Well, let's ask a few people now as we're walking along Main Street. This man coming with the sickle and the alligator case. Ah.. [Audience Laughter] Pardon me, sir.</p>
            <p>[Sergei Stroganoff]  I am Sergei Stroganoff, dance critic at Russia's outstanding tabloid, Pravda.</p>
            <p>[Fred Allen]  Well, tell me, Sergei, what about comedy? You know, comedy in Russian radio.</p>
            <p>[Sergei Stroganoff]  In Russia we have a comedian, he is very funny.</p>
            <p>[Fred Allen]  Something like, ah, Bob Hope?</p>
            <p>[Sergei Stroganoff]  In Russia there is no hope.</p>
            <p>[Audience Laughter]</p>
            <p>[Fred Allen]  Well, who is your comedian?</p>
            <p>[Sergei Stroganoff]  Who else? Stalin.</p>
            <p>[Audience Laughter]</p>
            <p>[Fred Allen]  Well-</p>
            <p>[Sergei Stroganoff]  Stalin is cracking jokes and doubling over with laughing.</p>
            <p>[Fred Allen]  The jokes are funny, eh?</p>
            <p>[Sergei Stroganoff]  The jokes don't have to be funny.</p>
            <p>[Audience Laughter]</p>
            <p>[Fred Allen]  Why not?</p>
            <p>[Sergei Stroganoff]  Comrade, in Russia when Stalin is laughing-</p>
            <p>[Fred Allen]  Yes?</p>
            <p>[Sergei Stroganoff]  Everybody is laughing.</p>
            <p>[Fred Allen]  Why?</p>
            <p>[Sergei Stroganoff]  You bore me. Long live the common force.</p>
            <p>[Fred Allen]  So long, Sergei.</p>
            <p>[Music]</p>
            <p>[Audience Applause]</p>

            <p>[Narrator] In this clip from NBC's <u>The Bob Hope Show</u>, Hope and frequent collaborator Jerry Colonna go head to head in a telephone exchange.</p>

            <p>[Phone Rings]</p>
            <p>[Bob Hope]  Hello?</p>
            <p>[Jerry Colonna]  Hello, Hope, I'm calling from this phone booth to tell you that ... and I tried to get exactly ... so now the only thing to do is ... see?</p>
            <p>[Audience Laughter]</p>
            <p>[Bob Hope]  Colonna, there must be something wrong with this connection. Why does everything you say have something missing in the middle?</p>
            <p>[Jerry Colonna]  Used a lifesaver instead of a nickel.</p>

            <p>[Dr. Demento]  Alfred Yankovic on the Dr. Demento show. We're gonna welcome Alfred officially to the land of dementia. Whatever urged you to take up the accordion,ah?</p>
            <p>[Alfred Yankovic]  Well, the only reason I picked up the accordion Doc was that it's very hard to play on the floor, and in my case, and things like that. It's better to get up at least three feet off the ground. Ya know.</p>
            <p>[Dr. Demento]  The two most demented accordionists I've ever heard are both named Yankovic. Are you related to the other one?</p>
            <p>[Alfred Yankovic]  Well, I have an uncle named Frank Yankovic, but unfortunately, he doesn't play the accordion.</p>
            <p>[Dr. Demento]  Okay. I'm thinking of course, of Frankie Yankovic, the polka musician who did "How Many Burps in a Bottle of Beer" and things like that. But ah, it is. [Incoherent Vocal Noises] You have demented me. [Incoherent Vocal Noises] It's uncontrollable.</p>
            <p>[Alfred Yankovic]  Calm down. Calm down Doc.</p>
            <p>[Dr. Demento]  It must be the fumes that come out of that accordion when you ex-... when it exhales, or something like that, that did it to me. Alfred Yankovic.</p>


            <h2>1980s: Big Hair and Big Names</h2>
            <p>[Narrator] Howard Stern earned fans—and FCC attention—with his edgy humor on the air. In this 1984 clip from <u>The Howard Stern Show</u>, Stern spoofs the TV gameshow <u>Match Game</u>.</p>

            <p>[Howard Stern]  Here we go. You've gotta match with our celebrities. Don't blurt out your answer. Give the celebrities time to write down their answer, okay. All right, and think hard about this one.  Blankly, heat. Blank-l-y heat. [Quiz Show Music] Blankly heat. And the celebrities are all thinking about it. And Sid Ronkus, you're having a hard time. Are you gonna have an answer for us? Alright, everybody. Okay, everybody. I think everybody has their answer written down, and what is your answer sir?</p>
            <p>[Guest on the Phone]  I'll say prick.</p>

            <p>[Sid Ronkus]  I have one, yes.</p>

            <p>[Narrator] Over his long career, Larry King has interviewed everyone from presidents to film stars. In this 1988 clip from his radio show, <u>The Larry King Show</u>, he interviews comedian and filmmaker Albert Brooks.</p>

            <p>[Larry King]  Thank you very much. We're back on the Larry King Show. And we have waited this hour, we were hoping he'd say yes. He said yes, Albert Brooks returns. And I consider him the funniest man in America. Academy Award nominee. What are you currently doing?</p>
            <p>[Albert Brooks]  I want to first of all start out by saying something. I was at dinner. I did do the show earlier this week and a lot of people said, "Gee, you were funny. Maybe you shouldn't go back. It'll be a let," and everything. And I said, "No, Larry's sick. He needs me." I always tell you, I always say, "Gee." Like I said to some of my friends who were listening on, I was real funny the other night.</p>
            <p>[Larry King]  You were.</p>
            <p>[Albert Brooks]  And I hate to say that 'cause I sound like, okay, well, I took a tape recorder at dinner. Because I was so funny at dinner. And if i tell you that ... for example, here.</p>
            <p>[Larry King]  You taped yourself at dinner?</p>
            <p>[Albert Brooks]  Yes. I taped the thing. And this is just a brief thing from, we were at a sushi bar.</p>
            <p>[Larry King]  You're gonna play us a tape from dinner to show us how funny you were.</p>
            <p>[Albert Brooks]  Just a little extra to show you how good it went. I mean, 'cause I, so you don't think I'm lying. This is just ten seconds out of a two hour dinner. [Tape starts playing] Listen to that. </p>
            <p>[Albert Brooks on Tape]  So he says, "I'm not this fat. I'm carrying three illegal aliens under here."</p>
            <p>[Man on Tape]  Albert, you're so funny now. Do you think you'll be this funny on the show?</p>
            <p>[Albert Brooks on Tape]  Don't worry about it. Let's have some more liquor.</p>
            <p>[Albert Brooks] That was just a small portion of the dinner Larry. That was ... </p>

            <p>[Narrator] Tom Snyder had a long career in broadcasting. In this 1988 clip from his radio show, he interviews famed animators William Hanna and Joseph Barbera, who discuss the connection between their animated series <u>The Flintstones</u>--and the pioneering sitcom <u>The Honeymooners</u>.</p>

            <p>[Tom Snyder]  We are back now with Bill Hanna and Joe Barbera, the founders of Hanna-Barbera Productions.</p>
            <p>[Joe Barbera]  You wanna hear something real funny about that?</p>
            <p>[Tom Snyder]  I wanna ask one thing about <u>The Flintstones</u>. A lot of people think that they really are Ralph and Alice Kramden in cartoon characters.</p>
            <p>[Bill Hanna]  Well, I'll tell you, at the time when we were asked to make that show, <u>The Honeymooners</u> were about the funniest show that I ever saw in my life.</p>
            <p>[Tom Snyder]  They still are funny.</p>
            <p>[Joe Barbera]  And still is.</p>
            <p>[Bill Hanna]  They are. I still look at them, and sometimes I laugh so hard. I cry. Terrific show. Anyway, we felt that if we do a show, we should make a show that has two couples. We listened to that show, and if it looks a little like that, it could be influenced by <u>The Honeymooners</u>, yes.</p>
            <p>[Tom Snyder]  Okay.</p>
            <p>[Joe Barbera]  Two things. At this point here, what <u>The Honeymooners</u> didn't have was a Stoneway piano, and they didn't have a Polarock camera, and they didn't have Ann-Margrock came in to guest on a show. [Laughter]</p>


            <p>[Narrator] Since 1974, the radio show <u>A Prairie Home Companion</u> has transported its listeners to a simpler time and place. In this 1987 clip we're taken on another adventure with Buster the show dog.</p>

            <p>[Radio Narrator]  When we left Buster and Father Finian and Timmy the sad, rich teenage boy and Sheila the Christian jungle girl last week, The S.S. Pimento had sunk in the Pacific Ocean, but that was a week ago, and a lot can happen in a week. A big cruise ship came by the other day and drew up alongside their life raft.</p>
            <p>[Man on Cruise Ship]  We're bound for Tahiti if you want to come aboard!</p>
            <p>[Sheila]  No thanks!/ We're going back to the Midwest!</p>
            <p>[Helicopter Blades]</p>
            <p>[Radio Narrator]  That afternoon, a big Coast Guard chopper came out and hoisted the four friends out of the water and took them straight to Hollywood and set them down on Wilshire Boulevard in front of a used Mercedes lot.</p>
            <p>[Organ play "Hooray for Hollywood"]</p>
            <p>[Father Finian]  All right, well, thanks for the lift there, and goodbye.</p>
            <p>[Sheila]  He was sure nice. Wasn't he, Buster?</p>
            <p>[Radio Narrator]  There was a pay phone right there on the corner, and Timmy called up his rich parents to get airfare home to St. Paul, but ...</p>
            <p>[Father Finian]  What's wrong, Timmy me lad?</p>
            <p>[Buster Barks]</p>
            <p>[Timmy]  Well, it was a recorded message. The number's no longer in service!</p>
            <p>[Sheila]  Call information!</p>
            <p>[Father Finian]  Well, his dad has an unlisted number because he's so widely despised be/ing so rich like he is, you know?</p>
            <p>[Shelia]  Oh no! </p>
            <p>[Timmy]  Boy are we in a pickle now! Got no money, and my rich, unlisted dad is now disconnected, too. Christ!</p>
            <p>[Radio Narrator]  That's all the time we have for today's Adventures of Buster the Show Dog, brought to you, perhaps, for the last time, who knows, by Scotty's Co/u/gh Syrup for Dogs!</p>
            <p>[Organ Music] [Applause]</p>

            <h2>Late ’90s to Now: Comedians Talk Story</h2>

            <p>[Narrator] David Sedaris's big break came in 1992, recounting his experience working in a department store during the holidays. Here’s a clip from that recording, which was made for NPR's <u>Morning Edition</u>.</p>

            <p>[David Sedaris]  I wear green velvet knickers, a forest green velvet smock, and a perky little hat decorated with spangles. This is my work uniform. </p>

            <p>[Smooth Jazz Music]</p>

            <p>[David Sedaris]  I've spent the last several days sitting in a crowded, windowless, Macy's classroom, undergoing the first phases of elf training. You could be an entrance elf, a water cooler elf, a bridge elf, train elf, maze elf, island elf, magic window elf, usher elf, cash register elf, or exit elf.</p>
            <p>We were given a demonstration of various positions in action, acted out by returning elves, who were so on-stage and goofy that it made me a little sick to my stomach. I don't know that I could look anyone in the eye and exclaim, "Oh my goodness! I think I see Santa!" Or, "Can you close your eyes and make a very special Christmas wish?"</p>
            <p>Everything these elves say seems to have an exclamation point on the end of it. It makes one's mouth hurt to speak with such forced merriment. It embarrasses me to hear people talk this way. I think I'll be a low-key sort of elf.</p>

            <p>[Narrator] Balancing his edgy brand of humor with insightful interviews, Howard Stern carved out a unique space in radio. In this clip from <u>The Howard Stern Show</u> on SiriusXM, Stern interviews comedian Bill Burr about his struggle to become a successful stand up comic.</p>

            <p>[Bill Burr]  I had just done the third show at the Funny Bone in St. Louis. It was the first time it hit me. I was about 12 years in, and I had nothing going on. Didn't have a manager. Didn't have an agent. I remember sitting there having a beer, and I was watching the waitresses counting their money and everybody smoking cigarettes. And I'd gone to the club five years in a row. Everybody looks older. I look older. And all of a sudden this thing hit me. It's like, "Am I that guy that doesn't make it?"</p>
            <p>[Howard Stern]  Did it ever occur to you to go to some comic who you respected and say, "Hey, I'm in a real negative space. I feel like I wasted 12 years of my life"?</p>
            <p>[Bill Burr]  I feel like if you do that to somebody, you can only do it to them one time.</p>
            <p>[Howard Stern]  Right.</p>
            <p>[Bill Burr]  Because trying to talk somebody back into their dream is [bleep] exhausting.</p>
            <p>[Howard Stern]  Exactly.</p>
            <p>[Bill Burr]  You know what I mean?</p>
            <p>[Howard Stern]  Yeah.</p>
            <p>[Bill Burr]  And I got a rule now. It's like, "I'm going to do it once." And the second time I'll be like, "Well, maybe you should sell cars, man."</p>
            <p>[Howard Stern]  What turned it around?</p>
            <p>[Bill Burr]  I don't know. I just kept doing it. I kept doing it, and I kept doing it. And then, I did your show a couple ... I opened for Dave Chappelle. I did your show a couple of times. There's two types of people that make it in this business. It's the, "Oh, my god. You're the guy," like you step off the bus with a piece of straw between your teeth, and you just make it at 23. And then, there's the guys, the rest of us, who make it in our 40s.</p>

            <p>[Narrator] Stand Up comedian Joe Rogan took his career in a new direction with his self-made podcast, <u>The Joe Rogan Experience</u>. In this 2017 clip, Rogan interviews comedy mogul Judd Apatow.</p>

            <p>[Joe Rogan]  Something happens somewhere along the line where Carrot Top owns props. They don't ... No one does props anymore. You remember when we first starting out, there was prop comics, it was a genre.</p>
            <p>[Judd Apatow]  I threw a couple of props first few times I went on stage. I remember bringing a light and putting it to my finger to make my finger look like E.T's finger. That's how little material I had. [Laughter]</p>
            <p>[Joe Rogan]  Isn't it funny though that that genre is just sort dissolved?</p>
            <p>[Judd Apatow]  I think it's funny as hell. I went to see Carrot Top in Vegas. I laughed my ass off. I brought my whole family. We really laughed hard. I've always for the silly guys. I love the smart people and the inventive people, but the silly guy is also pretty great and it's hard to write super silly jokes that make people laugh out loud.</p>
            <p>[Joe Rogan]  Yeah.</p>
            <p>[Judd Apatow]  And the one thing that Carrot Top did that made me laugh was he runs around the crowd and somebody's giving the crowd shots. He's handing out cups and really fast pouring shots and they're spilling on people. He's running around and then he turns to some lady, was like, "Oh, I can't give it to you. You're pregnant." But she clearly wasn't pregnant. It was just a chubby lady and it got really awkward for a moment.</p>
            <p>[Joe Rogan]  Oh, no.</p>
            <p>[Judd Apatow]  That's always the best when you make that mistake.</p>

            <p>[Narrator] Receiving the Guinness World Record for the World's Most Downloaded Podcast, <u>The Ricky Gervais Show</u> helped to bring podcasting into the mainstream. In this clip, we catch a glimpse of the show’s absurdist humor.</p>

            <p>[Karl Pilkington]  I don't quite understand how face transplants work because, do you get a choice of who you have? If they had a catalog and they said, "Here's some faces you can have. Pick which one you want," would you be looked upon badly if you go, "Do you know what? I don't really like the look of any of them. Can I just wait for a better face?" Or at this moment in time, if you just got to take what's on offer.</p>
            <p>[Ricky Gervais]  Karl, there's no one looking through catalogs of faces they might be able to have in the face ...</p>
            <p>[Karl Pilkington]  No, they do know because of the face transplant thing.</p>
            <p>[Ricky Gervais breaks into Laughter]</p>
            <p>[Karl Pilkington]  I wanna see what I'm having because I could end up with anything. You mentioned an elephant's head. Whose head are they gonna use? Is it the latest thing that's died? "Oh, well, this got run over before. Yeah, stick this on your head."</p>
            <p>[Ricky Gervais]  Where does this come from ... [Laughter]</p>
            <p>[Stephen Merchant]  From his mind.</p>
            <p>[Ricky Gervais]  ... where his face is queuing up to be popped on a skull? Where do you think that have got time to put all these ...</p>
            <p>[Karl Pilkington]  Maybe this is why it won't catch on. I don't know.</p>
            <p>[Stephen Merchant]  This is extraordinary. You've created in your own head the existence of this pamphlet, and now you're defending it even though we don't know if it even exists.</p>
            <p>[Ricky Gervais]  You're this skull on this hospital bed saying, "I'm not having that. I don't like the look of it. It looks a bit shifty. I don't like. I don't know."</p>

            <h1>Sounds Funny</h1>
            <p>What makes the best comedy so funny?</p>

            <p>Along with well-crafted jokes, unforgettable performances, and clever sight gags, another key element deserves credit for the laughs: sound! From the visceral squish of pie meeting face, to the exaggerated kaboom in a classic cartoon, sound effects make comic moments more believable and absurd situations more hilarious. They are the salt and pepper of comedy, enhancing the flavor of almost every humorous scene.</p>

            <p>The art of sound design remains a mysterious process to many, as it occurs in darkened recording studios and behind the closed doors of Foley stages. Foley artists, named after sound pioneer Jack Foley, re-create everything from stealthy footsteps to sucker punches, perfectly syncing their movements with picture. Timing is key, but so is ingenuity. When Fred Flintstone’s feet start his car, we’re actually hearing hands slapping a leather couch. And when a spine cracks in <u>The Big Lebowski</u>, the sound comes from the crunch of celery being twisted.</p>

            <p>While Foley artists typically perform their effects, sound designers build sound tracks using a combination of stock effects, field recordings, and sounds created from scratch. The process is painstaking—and often highly creative. For <u>Toy Story 2</u>, the rasp of Wheezy the penguin involved combining a squeak toy with the sound of air being blown through a clarinet mouthpiece. The slurpy greetings that Woody receives from his horse came from real-life recordings of a cow licking peanut butter off someone’s face.</p>

            <p>Mixed seamlessly together with dialogue and music, these effects create the soundscapes underpinning some of the funniest moments in film and television. The comic impact is deeply felt but rarely noticed—which means the men and women of sound design are doing their jobs perfectly.</p>

            <h2>The Marriage of Comedy and Music</h2>

            <p>As an art form, musical comedy spans generations and crosses genres. It’s a hallmark of classic sketch shows like <u>Monty Python’s Flying Circus</u> and <u>Saturday Night Live</u>, where characters frequently and absurdly break into song. Parody artists from “Weird Al” Yankovic to the Lonely Island perfectly mimic musical groups to hilarious effect, while satirists often use music to share social and political commentary—whether that’s <u>South Park</u> characters singing about American hypocrisy or Mel Brooks mocking Hitler with a song-and-dance routine.</p>

            <p>What makes comedy and music such an enduring combination? Perhaps it’s the blend of catchy melodies and clever lyrics, or the contrast of sophisticated rhythms and shocking punch lines. Musical comedy also offers an emotional experience, a direct line of communication between artist and audience. Singing along, tapping our toes, laughing at shared references, we are wonderfully in on the joke.</p>

            <h2>Michael Dukakis</h2>
            <p>(sung to the tune of "K-K-K-Katy")</p>
            <p>Michael Dukakis, Michael Dukakis.<br/>He's the only one whose name is fun to say (Michael Dukakis)<b/>Delightfully ethnic and multisyllabic<br/>What better reason to vote for any of them today.</p>

            <p>The bottom line in politics is name identity<br/>From a crowded field to give your man a push<br/>So, barring a surprise from Mario or Kennedy,<br/>We're syllable impaired - with Kemp or Hart or Bush.</p>

            <p>Ah, but Michael Dukakis, Michael Dukakis <br/>There's a name to capture every heart.<br/>The name is so neat. It is fun to repeat it.<br/>It sounds just like a car that will not start<br />Michael Dukakis, Michael Dukakis, Michael Dukakis...</p>

            <h2>A Good Lieutenant Colonel</h2>
            <p>(sung to the tune of "A Modern Major-General")</p>
            <p>He is the very model of a good lieutenant colonel<br/>Serving his commander from the A.M. to nocturnal.<br/>He testified for hours sipping diet Coca-Cola<br/>With his version of a covert op to renew the Ayatollah.</p>

            <p>He took the rap for Ronnie who was in and out of touch again.<br/>Sometimes he'd lay the blame on William Carey who was dead by then.<br/>He told of the diversion and how proud he was to do it<br/>As the nation watched he held a hoop and Congress jumped right through it.</p>

            <p>He lashed out at the liberals and assorted Contra-wreckers<br/>And the only one thing missing was a little dog named Checkers.<br/>Wives compared him to their husbands whom they thought were not worth keeping<br/>Why can't you be like Ollie? On the sofa you'll be sleeping.</p>

            <p>So this charismatic colonel filled the nation's needs so vital<br/>And the Great Communicator is relinquishing his title.<br/>*He'll get the Contra aid he wants and a figure far above it<br/>Cause Ollie gave us all a snow job. It was hot and we all loved it.</p>

            <p>Poindexter had to follow in the wake of North the hero<br/>In civilian clothes he puffed his pipe. Charisma down to zero.<br/>He said the the Gipper's innocent, the smoking gun is missing.<br/>That's why for 7 months he left his boy hanging there and twisting.</p>

            <p>*(Changed to) His peace plan for the Contras is rather misbegotten<br/>But that's OK cause Ollie North is practically forgotten.</p>

            <h2>Seventy-Six Complaints</h2>
            <p>(sung to the tune of "Seventy-Six Trombones")</p>

            <p>Seventy-six complaints hit the nominee<br/>With 110 brickbats in the wake.<br/>It went on for days and days with women, blacks and gays<br/>Who knew that Bork would burn them at the stake.</p>

            <p>Seventy-six small groups up to Congress came<br/>With the record of Bork to be stomped upon.<br/>But Bork didn't bat an eye - looking somber for a guyWhose wispy little beard seems pasted on.</p>

            <p>The Democratic senators went after him<br/>Patrick Leahy, Kennedy and Howard Metzenbaum.<br/>The three of them grew weaker<br/>And mentally inferior<br/>Not knowing quite where Bork was coming from.</p>

            <p>Seventy-six complaints came from far and wide<br/>Petitions were pouring in with dispatch.<br/>But if you turn Bork away - Reagan says you'll make my day<br/>Cause waiting in the wings is Orrin Hatch.</p>

            <p>That's where I'm headin'<br/>Reagan's legacy is Bork and Orrin Hatch<br/>And Armageddon.<br/>Let us pray it’s Robert Bork or Orrin Hatch.</p>

            <h2>I'm Dreaming of a White House Pardon</h2>
            <p>(sung to the tune of "I'm Dreaming of a White Christmas")</p>

            <p>I'm dreaming of a White House Pardon<br/>Just like the one for you know who.<br/>All wrapped up in holly, for John and Ollie.<br/>So it goes - What else is new?</p>

            <p>Who needs the Special Prosecutor?<br/>He's packed his bags and leaves tonight<br/>May your days be merry and bright<br/>And may all your whitewashes be white.</p>

            <h2>circa 1960s</h2>

            <p>Shelley Berman’s career began at Chicago’s Goodman Theatre, where he was trained as a dramatic actor. Berman was invited to join the Compass Players: the innovative Chicago-based improvisational troupe that would go on to become The Second City. While performing with the Compass Players, Shelley Berman developed a solo act employing an imaginary telephone. He auditioned the routine at the legendary Mister Kelly’s in 1957 and vaulted to immediate acclaim.</p>
            <p> Berman’s early performances led to nightclub engagements across the country, countless TV appearances, and a recording contract with Verve Records. <u>Inside Shelley Berman</u> - released in early 1959 - was the first comedy album to be awarded a Gold Record (displayed here), and the first non-musical recording to win a Grammy Award. Shelley Berman was the first stand-up comedian booked to play Carnegie Hall.</p>

            <p>Shelley Berman’s unique brand of anxiety-ridden observational humor helped to redefine stand-up comedy in the late 1950s and ‘60s. </p>

            <p>“Shelley Berman came along with that whole new wave of comedy. It forever changed the way we look at stand-up comedy.”</p>
            <p>—Fred Willard</p>

            <p>Berman continued to perform comedy across the country, and appeared consistently on Broadway, in films, and on television until 2014. In 2008, he received an Emmy nomination for his portrayal of Nat David, Larry David’s father, on <u>Curb Your Enthusiasm</u>. Berman authored four books, two plays, and numerous poems, and taught humor writing at USC for over twenty years.</p>

            <p>Shelley Berman carefully stored creative records in his home office for seven decades. The material was arranged in filing cabinets and itemized using a Rolodex, whose entries are labeled with dates ranging from the 1940s to 2010s. The cabinets contain thousands of pages that not only chronicle the career of a pioneering comedic artist, but the broader history of comedy across the second half of the 20th century. In hundreds of photographs, calendars, contracts, and correspondences, Berman’s archive tracks the development of modern stand-up comedy in the 1950s and 1960s, as well as the rise of the comedic recording industry (in which he played an early and instrumental role).</p>
            <p>So precise and purposeful was Shelley Berman’s comedy, that he carried a custom-built stool with him from gig to gig as he travelled across the country performing his act. As a “sit-down” stand-up, Berman organized his act around this particular seat (with a carefully placed rung upon which to perch his feet) so that he would not be distracted by rickety stools of variable heights that might be found backstage at comedy clubs. After each show, he disassembled it with a portable toolkit and packed it in a metal case, now marked with airline stickers from his many trips to nightclubs across the country.</p>

            <p>In this original telegram form September 1958, comedian Mort Sahl urges Shelley Berman to make a comedy album. One year later,<u> Inside Shelley Berman</u> became the first non-musical recording to win a Grammy Award and the first comedy album to "go gold."</p>

            <p>At a moment when representations of women in professional creative roles were few and far between, Rose Marie’s confident, intelligent, and very funny portrayal of comedy writer Sally Rogers on <u>The Dick Van Dyke Show</u> (1961-1966) galvanized a generation. </p>

            <p>“Gloria Steinem famously said ‘You have to see it to be it.’ And Rose Marie’s portrayal of Sally Rogers was what made so many women believe that we could be comedy writers. Rose Marie was a feminist role model who made us all laugh. That’s a legacy that’s hard to beat.” </p>
            <p>—Nell Scovell</p>

            <p>“She was fast, and strong. What I saw, as a young girl, was a brazenly funny, professional, independent career woman who held her own in a workplace full of men.”</p>
            <p>—Paula Poundstone</p>

            <p>“Baby Rose Marie” was a vaudeville headliner, coast-to-coast radio host, and successful recording artist by the age of five. She entertained Presidents Coolidge, Hoover, and Roosevelt, and starred in some of the first “talking films,” including the 1929 Vitaphone short <u>Baby Rose Marie the Child Wonder</u>. In 1946, Rose Marie became the First Lady of Vegas when Bugsy Siegel booked her as the historic opening act at his casino-hotel, The Flamingo. </p>

            <p>Rose Marie’s prolific nine-decade career, spanning the 1920s until her death in 2017, is considered one of the longest and most versatile in entertainment history. In a collection of dozens of meticulously prepared scrapbooks, Rose Marie chronicled every facet of 20th century American entertainment from her unique first hand perspective. Always armed with a camera and a pen, she recorded the now-elusive histories of vaudeville, radio, live theater, and early television as she lived them. These scrapbooks contain hundreds of never-before-seen photographs, rare memorabilia, and correspondence with paragons of American comedy from the 1920s to 2000s.</p>

            <h1>Sketch & Improv</h1>

            <p>Comic scenes—both ad-libbed and scripted—date to the earliest days of theater, but it wasn’t until the 1950s that both improv and sketch began their rise to prominence. Television variety shows brought short, scripted, character-driven sketches into America’s living rooms, while Chicago-based theater troupes developed a new form of spontaneously improvised comedy, often collaborative and based on audience input.</p>

            <p>Over the years, sketch and improv have evolved and intertwined, with comedians regularly moving between groups and formats. Together, the two genres have shaped the comedy landscape, from the influential sketches of <u>The Carol Burnett Show</u>, <u>Saturday Night Live</u>, and <u>SCTV</u>, to the improv obsession that's seen troupes and classes springing up across the nation.</p>

            <h2> The Rise of Sketch </h2>
            <p>Airing from 1950 to 1954, <u>Your Show of Shows</u> may not have invented sketch comedy, but it’s arguably the first television program to have perfected it. Written by a team of comedic geniuses, including Mel Brooks, Mel Tolkin, and Neil Simon, the show featured a virtuoso cast led by Sid Caesar and Imogene Coca.</p>

            <p>Most variety programs of the day trafficked in jokes and schtick, but <u>Your Show of Shows</u> won laughs with outrageously memorable characters like Caesar’s incomprehensible German professor. The collective intensity of the cast also laid waste to any claim that the 1950s popular culture pulled its punches. Before <u>The Honeymooners</u> spoofed the American husband and wife, “The Hickenloopers” exposed a turbulent alternative to domestic bliss—one wholly out of sync with postwar clichés.</p>

            <h2> Improv takes The Stage </h2>

            <p>Dissatisfied with Broadway’s elitist tendencies, a young impresario named David Shepherd dreamt of a people’s theater staged by amateur players. But how could untrained actors plucked from an audience possibly deliver? Shepherd found his answer when he met director Paul Sills in Chicago in 1952. Sills contributed the improvisational theater games developed by his mother, acting teacher Viola Spolin, and the Compass Players—America’s first improv troupe—was born.</p>

            <p>Along with fellow members Shelley Berman and Alan Alda, future legends Mike Nichols and Elaine May found their feet at the Compass, using comedy to air the neurotic taboos of mid-century America. Their classic sketches included “Mother and Son”—about a harried rocket scientist “too busy” to call his poor Jewish mother—and “Teenagers,” in which two bumbling adolescents flail their way to a kiss. </p>

            <h2> Chicago Scene Ignites </h2>

            <p>In 1959, director Paul Sills, along with producers Bernie Sahlins and Howard Alk, founded a new improvisational theater, which they christened The Second City—an ironic tribute to Chicago’s supposed cultural inferiority to New York. Before long, the cast had established the format that survives at Second City to this day: an evening of sketches followed by a free improv set.</p>

            <p>Virtually overnight, the Second City grew from local hit to national phenomenon. Where else in America could audiences go for uncensored satire tailored to their requests? (Certainly not their living rooms, where sponsor-friendly television comedies catered to mainstream sensibilities.) In 1972, Second City Toronto opened, providing fertile training ground for performers such as Catherine O'Hara, Euguene Levy, John Candy, and Martin Short, many of whom rose to fame on Second City's television sketch Show, <u>SCTV</u>.</p>

            <h2> Mind Expanding Theater </h2>

            <p>In 1963, Alan Myerson left Second City for San Francisco and opened the Committee, an improvisational theater on a mission to expose truths, change minds, and incite revolutions. Myerson’s ensemble riffed on Janis Joplin, LSD, and LBJ, but made its name breaking down the “fourth wall” that separated improviser from audience. Joints were passed from the stage and back, and audience members participated in scenes as long and freewheeling as any acid trip.</p>

            <p>At the same time, East Coast innovator Ted Flicker was rethinking the Premise, the improv theater he had founded as an antidote to tired Broadway productions. Inspired by the civil rights movement, Flicker recreated his theater in 1963 as a forum for racial dialogue, with three Black performers and three white. The newly christened Living Premise created partially improvised sketches with the urgency of protest: critiques of JFK's stance on race, a portrait of an interracial love affair, even a scene about two Black extremists attempting to kidnap the first lady. During its brief tenure, the Living Premise gave New York City its first integrated repertory and a model for the future of improv.</p>

            <h2>The Beatles of Comedy </h2>

            <p>No one fused the high-low forces of erudition and abject silliness quite like Monty Python, a British sketch troupe that included Graham Chapman, Eric Idle, Terry Gilliam, Terry Jones, John Cleese, and Michael Palin. Broadcast from 1969 to 1974, <u>Monty Python’s Flying Circus</u> featured sketches like “Argument Clinic” (“Is this the right room for an argument?” “I’ve told you once.” “No, you haven’t!” “Yes, I have!”) that imbued utter nonsense with a logic so rigorous, it belied the absurdity of the premise. </p>

            <p>The troupe’s tendency to interrupt sketches with new sketches and directly address the camera lent the show a stream-of-consciousness flow and sense of gleeful chaos. It took a culture renowned for its formality to produce this gang of ingenious renegades, who deferred to nothing.</p>

            <h2> Hilarity in Hollywood </h2>

            <p>When improv troupe the Committee disbanded in 1972, many former members embarked on television careers, but Gary Austin eschewed sitcoms for the stage. Committed to honing his craft, he recruited Los Angeles performers to join him in workshopping scenes, developing characters, and writing original monologues. They soon attracted an audience, and in 1974, the group dubbed themselves the Groundlings, after the 17th-century plebeians who watched Shakespeare's plays from the foot of the stage.</p>

            <p>The Groundlings quickly became a casting room for producers, including Lorne Michaels, who tried-unsuccessfully-to poach Austin to direct <u>Saturday Night Live</u>. Nonetheless, a pipeline soon developed between the Groundlings and <u>SNL</u>, Laraine Newman the first of many Groundlings members to join the show's cast. <u>SNL</u> characters like Julia Sweeney’s androgynous Pat and Will Ferrell and Cheri Oteri’s high-strung Spartan cheerleaders were born on the Groundlings' stage, as was Pee-wee Herman, created and played by Paul Reubens. In 1978, the troupe opened a school of improv, whose noteworthy alumni included Phil Hartman, Maya Rudolph, and Kristen Wiig.</p>

            </div>
            <h2> Live From New York </h2>

            <p>The problem, according to producer Lorne Michaels, was that mainstream television comedy was “dealing with the problems of another generation—divorce, Valium, crabgrass, adultery.” He envisioned a different sort of sketch show, one suffused with the edge and energy of rock ’n’ roll. In 1975, Michaels cast <u>Saturday Night Live</u> with punk talent versed in improv. Though the cast worked from scripts, the show had the unpredictable feel of a nightclub act. </p>

            <p>With characters such as John Belushi’s explosive samurai and Dan Aykroyd’s wannabe swinger Yortuk Festrunk (“We are . . . two wild and crazy guys!”), the show raised a middle finger to staid late-night material. In later decades, <u>SNL</u> kept up its provocations, from “Mr. Robinson’s Neighborhood”—Eddie Murphy’s parody version of <u>Mister Rogers' Neighborhood</u>—to Tina Fey’s pitch-perfect spoofs of vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin. Remarkably, after more than 40 years on the air, the edgy version of sketch that Michaels pioneered had lost none of its authority.</p>

            <h2>Changing the Game</h2>

            <p>Improv guru Del Close had grown weary of short-format improv by the time he met Charna Halpern, an equally restless improviser who'd been associated with David Shepherd’s Improv Olympics in the early '80s. Spurred by Halpern, Close codified a structure for a new, longer format. “The Harold,” as the form came to be known, was comprised of scenes and games that allowed a story to unfold spontaneously. It was the most significant innovation in the art form since the founding of the first improv troupe.</p>

            <p>Halpern and Close opened the ImprovOlympic Theater, a site devoted to teaching the Harold. The iO soon became Chicago’s most progressive improv venue, drawing a new generation of comedic talents, including Tina Fey, Amy Poehler, Chris Farley, and Adam McKay, and sparking a full-blown theatrical renaissance in the Windy City.</p>

            <h2> Homey Don't Play That </h2>

            <p>Created by Keenen Ivory Wayans, <u>In Living Color</u> exploded onto the sketch scene in 1990, effectively ending the white dominion of variety comedy. The show’s fresh voice and crossover appeal earned it a Primetime Emmy and a giant viewership, turning many of its stars—Damon Wayans, David Alan Grier, and Jim Carrey—into household names. </p>

            <p>Here at last was hip-hop in sketch form: Damon Wayans as Homey D. Clown, a parolee unfit to entertain kids; “The Homeboy Shopping Network,” where convicted criminals sold stolen goods; and “Men on Film,” a movie-review show à la Siskel & Ebert, featuring two gay Black critics (“I give it two snaps up!”). Choreographed dances from the Fly Girls, featuring a young Jennifer Lopez, drove home the point that <u>In Living Color</u> offered a fresh, unsterilized brand of comedy.</p>

            <h2> Guerrilla Improve</h2>

            <p>In mid-’90s Chicago, a revolving ensemble of guerrilla improvisers, including Matt Besser, Amy Poehler, Ian Roberts, and Matt Walsh, dubbed themselves the Upright Citizens Brigade. Guided by the anarchic teachings of mentor Del Close, the troupe launched face-first into improvised pranks—both onstage and on the street—that had audiences wondering “Is this really happening?” and “Is this even legal?” At one point, UCB incited a riot, with performer Horatio Sanz leading some 50 people in a political protest-complete with tiki torches. On another occasion, the group advertised Adam McKay's public suicide; crowds turned out to see a CPR dummy dressed in McKay's clothes thrown off a building. Once the cops came.</p>

            <p>In 1996, the Upright Citizens Brigade founded a theater in New York City and scored a deal with Comedy Central. Their self-titled series reveled in good-bad taste, transcendent stupidity, and general discomfort. Today, with theaters in Los Angeles and New York, a catalog of classes, a podcast, and even a coffee bar, UCB has become a bicoastal comedy empire, shaping the next generation of improv talent.</p>

            <h2>The Future of Sketch</h2>

            <p>What’s next for sketch? With so much media channels available and the days of a general audience long gone, the trend is toward risk-taking material and granular humor. While television series like <u>Chappelle’s Show</u> and <u>Inside Amy Schumer</u> have pushed the envelope, sketches like <u>Portlandia</u>’s “Put a Bird on It” sketch—a laugh at the indie world’s latest DIY trend—has the appeal of an inside joke targeting a small demographic.</p>

            <p>In the right hands, even the most esoteric observation can reverberate on the grand scale. <u>Key and Peele</u>’s “Office Homophobe” sketch parses factions among gay people of color and ends as one self-proclaimed hate victim realizes, “Oh. . . I’m not persecuted. I’m just an a--hole.”</p>

            <p><u>Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In</u> was a groundbreaking sketch-comedy series. The hyper-paced NBC show ran from 1968 to 1973, and introduced a style of chaotic, politically fearless humor that’s still popular today. </p>

            <p><u>Laugh-In</u> was also a talent incubator, and helped launch the careers of legends such as Goldie Hawn, Lily Tomlin, and SNL creator Lorne Michaels. Fans of the series enjoyed trademark bits like the Joke Wall, which performers would pop out of to deliver absurd jokes and one-liners. </p>

            <p>Garry Shandling found widespread success in the 1980s as a stand-up comic, and went on to create and star in two highly acclaimed television series. <u>It's Garry Shandling's Show</u> and <u>The Larry Sanders Show</u> were both groundbreaking works of comedy that often blurred the lines between fiction and reality.</p>

            <p>One of the most acclaimed television series of all time, <u>The Larry Sanders Show</u> centered on a fictional late-night show, with Garry Shandling playing the title role. The series was biting and fearless, and deftly lampooned the entertainment industry.</p>

            <p><u>The Larry Sanders Show</u> was also more than a straightforward comedy. Running from 1992 to 1998, it featured a naturalistic blend of drama and humor—a distinctive style that would reappear in shows like <u>The Office</u> and <u>30 Rock</u>. It was also a hub of comedic talent, establishing producers like Brad Gray and Judd Apatow, and actors including Janeane Garofalo, Penny Johnson Jerald, Jeffrey Tambor, Bob Odenkirk, and Jon Stewart.</p>

            <p>It's and intuitive belief: Laughter makes us feel better. But there is also tangible evidence that comedy can, in a very real way, heal our wounds. Humor has the power to provide an emotional catharsis, build empathy, unite communities, and even boost the immune system.</p>

            <h2> Lee Berk, et al. (“Neuroendocrine and stress hormone changes during mirthful laughter”)</h2>
            <p>Pathologists and medical researchers have found that laughter can have broad benefits for human health. These include the reduction of cortisol–the so-called “stress hormone”—and improvements in the immune system.</p>

            <h2>Willibard Ruch:</h2>
            <p>Psychologists such as Willibald Ruch have studied the ways humor promotes happiness and well-being. Their findings suggest that laughter can improve mood and strengthen relationships, while certain forms of “corrective humor”–similar to satire–can help change negative behavior.</p>
            <h2>Maria Bamford</h2>
            <p>In the 2010s, Maria Bamford’s stand-up routines and online sketches highlighted her struggles with bipolar disorder, anxiety, and OCD. Beyond getting laughs, she helped shine a light on mental illness, offering solace to those who suffered privately.</p>
            <h2><u>SNL</u></h2>
            <p>Less than three weeks after the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center, New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani delivered an uplifting monologue on <u>Saturday Night Live</u>, saying the city needed its institutions up and running—including <u>SNL</u>. Show creator Lorne Michaels came onstage and asked Giuliani, “Can we be funny?” In a nod to the healing power of comedy, Giuliani wryly answered: “Why start now?”</p>
            <h2>Dick Gregory</h2>
            <p>Dick Gregory often said that as a comedian, his priority was to get laughs. Yet his sharp-tongued stand-up bits did much more than that. By educating white Americans about racial inequality, Gregory shifted attitudes during the civil rights movement, a struggle to which he was deeply committed.</p>
            <h2>Anthony Ashley Cooper, the Third Earl of Shaftesbury</h2>
            <p>For centuries, philosophers have dissected humor, trying to understand it. In his 1709 essay, English philosopher Anthony Ashley Cooper held that laughter is like a relief valve for “the natural free spirits of ingenious men.”</p>
            <h2>Mel Brooks</h2>
            <p>A Jewish entertainer, Mel Brooks used song-and-dance routines to ridicule Adolf Hitler in films like <u>The Producers</u> and <u>To Be or Not to Be</u>. Comedy offered a satisfying form of revenge for Brooks, stripping the dictator of his posthumous power. Said Brooks, “It’s been one of my lifelong jobs—to make the world laugh at Adolf Hitler.”</p>
            <h2>Tig Notaro</h2>
            <p>In 2012, stand-up comedian Tig Notaro was hospitalized with a life-threatening infection, unexpectedly lost her mother, broke up with her girlfriend, and received a breast cancer diagnosis—all within four months. During one stand-up show, Notaro spontaneously decided to take a risk and share her story. “It was just the bursting-at-the-seams, cathartic moment onstage,” said Notaro of the now-famous performance.</p>
            <h2>Patch Adams</h2>
            <p>Many people know Patch Adams from the 1998 movie of the same name, starring Robin Williams. But the film wasn’t entirely fiction. Hunter “Patch” Adams was a real doctor who saw humor as a powerful tool to alleviate his patients’ suffering, and he delivered this message in presentations across 70 countries.</p>

            <h1>Political Humor</h1>
            <p>In many ways, comedy has always been a political act. It challenges our social norms and or tendency to think, "That's just the way things are." Yet certain comedians have taken their commentary a step further, critiquing some of the nation's most powerful institutions, from the presidency to the media.</p>

            <h2>Weekend Update</h2>
            <p>In many ways, <u>Saturday Night Live</u>’s “Weekend Update” created the template for the satirical news program. The segment, which first aired in 1975, was heralded for its satirical take on U.S. media and politics. It has featured an impressive roster of fearless and outspoken news anchors, including Chevy Chase in its inaugural season, Norm Macdonald in the ‘90s, and Tina Fey and Amy Poehler in the mid-2000s.</p>
            <h2>Tina Fey</h2>
            <p>In 2008, Tina Fey delivered skewering impressions of vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin. Her sketches on <u>Saturday Night Live</u> depicted Palin as naive and ditzy, earning Fey rave reviews from fans and critics, as well as an Emmy in 2009. Beyond their comic appeal, Fey’s impressions had a significant effect on the election: Researchers found the sketches dissuaded voters from supporting Palin—and presidential candidate John McCain.</p>
            <h2>Dennis Miller</h2>
            <p>For decades, stand-up comic and <u>SNL</u> star Dennis Miller has been an outspoken political comedian, one whose views shifted from liberal to conservative in later years. His 2006 take on congressional hearings: “What sort of empty-headed PEZ-dispenser séance am I watching here? Am I supposed to take these guys seriously?”</p>
            <h2>The Onion</h2>
            <p>Launched in 1988, The Onion has become the most respected satirical newspaper in the United States. Beyond making fun of pop culture and everyday life, the paper’s mock news stories have deftly attacked politicians, governmental hypocrisy, and injustices around the world.</p>
            <h2>Will Rogers</h2>
            <p>A cowboy, circus performer, a vaudeville star, film actor, and newspaper columnist. Will Rogers was also one of America’s most important political humorists. In the early 1900s, he helped popularize off-the-cuff jokes about current events, often making wry observations about both political parties. With his folksy persona and broad appeal, Rogers was able to openly lampoon Congress and other powerful institutions.</p>
            <h2>Mort Sahl</h2>
            <p>Mort Sahl changed the face of stand-up comedy in the early 1950s, pioneering a brand of socially aware stand-up that took a decidedly skeptical view of those in power. With his trademark V-neck sweater and a newspaper tucked under his arm, Sahl took aim at both Democrats and Republicans leaders. “Liberals feel unworthy of their possessions," he noted. "Conservatives feel they deserve everything they've stolen.”</p>
            <h2>Lewis Black</h2>
            <p>Starting in the 1990s, Lewis Black's popular stand-up routines became a conduit for political rage. His prickly, finger-pointing rants addressed a range of charged topics, from health care to poverty to the U.S. presidency. Despite his vocal disdain for America's leaders, Black expressed a profound respect for the armed forces, taking his unique brand of political humor on multiple USO tours.</p>
            <h2>Smothers Brothers</h2>
            <p>In the late 1960s, America was living through political and cultural upheaval. Yet most television programs at the time remained innocuous. <u>The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour </u>pushed boundaries where others didn’t, openly criticizing the Vietnam War, challenging both the Johnson and Nixon administrations, and battling the CBS censors—ultimately resulting in the network’s ending the show in 1969.</p>
            <h2>Bill Maher</h2>
            <p>In the 1990s, Bill Maher established himself as a fearless political commentator. As the host of the talk show <u>Politically Incorrect</u>, Maher used comedy to dissect politics, religion, and culture, frequently encouraging a healthy discourse between his guests. In 2003, he began hosting <u>Real Time with Bill Maher</u> on HBO, a move that allowed him to embrace controversial topics, from marijuana legalization to media censorship, without fear of network reprisal.</p>
            <h2>Jon Stewart</h2>
            <p><u>The Daily Show</u> in the Jon Stewart era wasn’t exactly a comedy, and it wasn’t exactly a news program. The late-night show was something of a hybrid, combining trenchant political analysis with satirical sketches. Between 1999 and 2015, Stewart popularized the format giving <u> Daily Show</u> correspondents like Samantha Bee, Stephen Colbert, and John Oliver a launchpad for their own satirical shows. Stewart also laid the foundation for his successor, Trevor Noah, who struck a cord with young, media-savvy audiences.</p>

          <article id="uso">
            <h1>The USO</h1>
            <p> In 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt helped create the United Service Organization, whose responsibilities to the military included comedy performances. Over many decades and hundreds of thousands of shows, US comedians have served the country by entertaining troops and booting morale around thee globe.</p>

            <h2>Robin Williams (2000s)</h2>
            <p>Between 2002 and 2013, Robin Williams entertained troops during six USO tours. He traveled the world and buoyed spirits—but not just through comedy. Williams spoke openly with the troops about their struggles, often in one-on-one conversations that gave soldiers a chance to share their personal stories.</p>

            <h2>Mickey Rooney (1945)</h2>
            <p>Mickey Rooney was many things—an actor, a comedian, a singer. He also served in the military from 1944 to 1946, working as an entertainer and radio personality, and earning laughs by performing characters impressions of Hollywood actors. Rooney was a charismatic USO performer whose colorful costumes and musical numbers buoyed the troops' spirits.</p>

            <h2>Bob Hope (1941)</h2>
            <p>With his first USO performance in 1941, comedian Bob Hope became one of the organization’s earliest stars. For nearly 50 years, Hope performed his variety shows in conflicts ranging from World War II to Vietnam to the Gulf War. His caustic comedy monologues made him a singular USO icon, and in 1997, Congress named Hope an honorary veteran.</p>

            <h2>Kathleen Madigan (2010)</h2>
            <p>Stand-up comedian Kathleen Madigan performed in multiple USO tours of Iraq and Afghanistan. The troops roared with laughter when she lampooned the herculean tasks that soldiers faced, and Madigan said the trips were personally meaningful. “The USO shows are the best,” she said. “No crowd is as appreciative and fired up.”</p>

            <h2>Phyllis Diller (60s)</h2>
            <p>Stand-up pioneer Phyllis Diller joined Bob Hope’s USO tours of Southeast Asia in the mid-1960s. The two performed together, playing a bickering couple. In 1978, Diller received the USO Liberty Bell Award for “demonstrating concern for the welfare and morale of America’s armed forces.”</p>

            <h2>Bob Hope (1990)</h2>
            <p>In 1990, nearly five decades after his debut, Bob Hope performed in his final USO tour, entertaining American troops in Saudi Arabia and Bahrain. The shows were also meant to engage viewers watching on NBC. “It’s important,” Hope said, “for the people at home to see the boys laughing and having a good time.”</p>

            <h2>Joe E. Brown</h2>
            <p>Between 1941 and 1947, USO entertainers put on more than 425,000 shows. One standout performer was Joe E. Brown, a comedian and actor known for his elastic grin. After crisscrossing the globe with his show, which included characterizations, pantomime, and dance numbers, Brown was awarded the Bronze Star.</p>

            <h2>Stephen Colbert (2009)</h2>
            <p>In 2009, late-night host Stephen Colbert took <u>The Colbert Report</u> to Iraq, where he interviewed generals, performed stand-up comedy, went through basic training, and even had his head shaved—efforts that earned him the moniker “Mr. USO.” In a performance for troops, Colbert joked about the war, saying, “Iraq: the country so nice we invaded it twice.”</p>

            <h2>Bob Hope (60s-70s)</h2>
            <p>Wielding his iconic golf club, Bob Hope delivered zinging one-liners for the troops in Vietnam. Yet his USO shows didn’t just entertain the military: In 1970, nearly half of the Americans with TVs tuned in to NBC to watch Hope’s Christmas Day performance in Long Binh, Vietnam.</p>

            <h2>Welcome to the Blue Room</h2>

            <p>Comedians aren’t known for pulling punches. Their art can be profane, explicit, controversial, and shocking. Some people find such boundary-pushing material refreshing and hilarious. Others do not.</p>

            <p>With this in mind, the National Comedy Center has designed a separate space—the Blue Room—for celebrating raw and uncensored comedy.

            <h1>Lenny Bruce</h1>

            <p>A legendary comedian and fierce iconoclast, Lenny Bruce revolutionized stand-up in the 1950s. At the time, most comics were still reciting tame routines and generic jokes. By contrast, Bruce’s sets were wild acts of self-expression, full of personal confession, improvised rants, and raw observations on sex, race, religion, and politics. </p>

            <p>Bruce’s insistence on pushing the boundaries of language, content, and form ushered in a new era of cerebral, artistic stand-up. It also invited controversy. By the early 1960s, the media had dubbed Bruce the leader of a “sick comedy” movement that included fellow comics such as Mort Sahl and Shelley Berman. </p>

            <p>Bruce soon became the target of local vice squads, conservative police departments, and even religious factions, all of which tried to end his career. Despite numerous arrests, he continued his no-holds-barred attacks on hypocrisy and complacency, until his death in 1966. Over half a century later, Bruce’s intelligence and irreverence still echo across the American comedy landscape.</p>

            <hr>

            <p>Bruce was always a prolific writer, an unconventional trait at a time when most comics hired outside people to develop their jokes. Along with crafting his own stand-up material, his written work included screenplays, pamphlets, essays, short stories, and teleplays.</p>

            <p>In the mid-1950s, Bruce found a new level of success as a screenwriter. He was hired to punch up the Donald O’Connor musical Walking My Baby Back Home; he sold a treatment to Alfred Hitchcock Presents; and he wrote several B movies, including 1953’s Dance Hall Racket, which he also starred in, and 1954’s The Rocket Man.</p>

            <p>Image of Lenny Bruce.</p>

            <hr>

            <p>By the late 1950s, Lenny Bruce had become a sought-after essayist for publications such as Rogue magazine and The Realist. He had a recurring column in Rogue called Bruce Here, in which his trademark “sick” social satire took many forms. One of his favorite formats: Brief screenplays full of absurd exchanges and a cast of characters that sometimes included a heightened version of himself.</p>

            <hr>

            <p>By the early 1960s, Lenny Bruce was a cultural phenomenon. His many television appearances, half a dozen comedy albums, and regular club performances had brought his unique brand of humor into the national spotlight. With notoriety, however, came increased attention from the authorities.</p>

            <p>Bruce was first arrested on obscenity charges in 1961, for saying cocksucker at San Francisco’s Jazz Workshop. Though he was eventually acquitted, he was arrested twice in Los Angeles the following year, then sentenced to a year in prison on charges stemming from a performance in Chicago. While out on bail, Bruce attempted to perform at a club in London, but was taken to the airport and deported to the United States. </p>

            <p>In 1964, Bruce began a run at Cafe Au Go Go in Greenwich Village. One night in early April, he was handcuffed by undercover detectives just before going onstage. A petition protesting his arrest was signed by more than 80 prominent figures—including Paul Newman, Bob Dylan, Susan Sontag, Norman Mailer, and John Updike—but the case still went to court that June.</p>

            <p>The highly publicized trial that ensued became a historic test of First Amendment rights. The case featured prominent witnesses, impassioned testimony, and a recess during which Bruce was hospitalized for acute chest inflammation. When the defense finally rested, it would be another 99 days before the court announced its verdict. </p>

            <p>It was during this time that Bruce crafted the statement seen below—an impassioned plea that was delivered to Judge Murtagh. On December 16, 1964, Murtagh sentenced Bruce to four months in the workhouse. Bruce remained free on bond during his appeal.</p>

            <hr>

            <p>Unfolding during his court case in New York, Lenny Bruce’s 1964 trial in California took place without him being present. </p>

            <p>Although the case was ultimately decided in Bruce’s favor, these original transcripts reveal how the court was forced to consider a new morality in an era now synonymous with emerging liberal culture.</p>

            <hr>

            <p>“Four years working in clubs—that’s what really made it for me—every night: doing it, doing, doing it, getting bored and doing different ways, no pressure on you, and all the other comedians are drunken bums who don’t show up, so I could try anything.” </p>
            <p>—Lenny Bruce </p>

            <p>In 1964, Lenny Bruce was writing essays for Playboy magazine when publisher Hugh Hefner commissioned him to write a memoir. Bruce largely dictated his autobiography to his friend Paul Krassner, a writer and counterculture icon who published the satirical underground paper The Realist. The two traveled around the country, working on the manuscript backstage each night before Bruce performed. The resulting memoir—its title a parody of the 1936 bestseller How to Win Friends and Influence People—was serialized in Playboy, whetting appetites for the book’s official publication in 1965.</p>

            <p>With its breezy style and piercing anecdotes, How to Talk Dirty and Influence People is uniquely Bruce. As seen in the early manuscript on display here, handwritten notes intermingle with the comedian’s words-capturing his intent to balance jokes and humorous observations with memories from his childhood and reflections on time spent with nightclub comics and Hollywood celebrities.</p>

            <p>Bruce died in 1966, less than a year after his autobiography’s official release. How to Talk Dirty and Influence People has remained in print ever since.</p>

            <h1>Art of the Roast</h1>

            <h2>Birth of the Roast</h2>

            <p>Roasts are mainstays of modern comedy, respected and attended by some of the biggest celebrities of our time. Although seen by millions today, these bawdy tributes began as invitation-only events, held behind the closed doors of the Friars Club. Founded in 1904 by a group of press agents, the Friars Club quickly evolved into a premier New York City social club for comedians and other entertainers. Members would honor their own with formal testimonial dinners, where speakers were invited to heap compliments on the guest of honor.</p>
            <p>Almost inevitably, good-natured ribbing began appearing among the kudos. Speakers would toss in a gentle barb here and an endearing insult there, and eventually their toasts contained more punch than praise—not to mention plenty of profanity. By 1950, these obscene, hilarious dinners had become an institution. Thus, the roast was born, as was the Friars’ new motto, “We only roast the ones we love.”</p>

            <h2>Hail to the Roast</h2>

            <p>When it comes to roasts, no one is off-limits—as the White House Correspondents’ Association proves with its annual roast of the U.S. president. Three years after these dinners began in 1921, Calvin Coolidge became the first president to attend. Jokes at the president’s expense were initially just a portion of the evening’s entertainment, but by the 1980s, the major focus had shifted to comedians skewering the commander in chief. </p>
            <p>In 2006, the Bush administration was incensed by barbs like this from Stephen Colbert: “The greatest thing about this man is he’s steady. . . . He believes the same thing Wednesday that he believed on Monday, no matter what happened Tuesday.” </p>
            <p>President Donald Trump skipped his own roast in 2017, but that didn’t deter host Hasan Minhaj from fulfilling his duties: “The news coming out of the White House is so stressful I’ve been watching House of Cards just to relax.”</p>

            <h2>Roasts Make a Comeback</h2>

            <p>In 1998, Comedy Central resurrected the roast, airing a Friars Club tribute to Drew Carey. The broadcast not only revived the tradition on television, but introduced a younger audience to the art of friendly skewering. After airing five Friars Club roasts, the network began producing its own shows in 2003, with Denis Leary as the first “victim.”</p>
            <p>Comedy Central’s no-holds-barred style proved highly popular. At the roast for comedian Bob Saget, actress Cloris Leachman earned high marks for her announcement: “I am not here to roast Bob Saget. I’m here to fuck John Stamos.”</p>
            <p>Charlie Sheen got burned twice in one night when his roast aired an hour after his character was killed off on the sitcom Two and a Half Men. Amy Schumer marked the occasion by firing off this shot at Sheen: “You’re just like Bruce Willis—you were big in the ’80s and now your old slot’s being filled with Ashton Kutcher.”</p>

            </div>
            <h2>Too Hot to Handle</h2>

            <p>Though roasts are notorious for off-color humor, they occasionally blast through boundaries and cross into cringe territory. The roastmaster typically keeps the show moving, but Ted Danson skidded out of control when he appeared in blackface to host Whoopi Goldberg’s Friars Club roast in 1993. Six years later, comedian Jeff Ross earned shocked laughter when he responded to Sandra Bernhard’s awkward serenade of Friars Club roastee Jerry Stiller. Said Ross: “Sandra Bernhard, holy shit! I wouldn’t fuck Sandra Bernhard with Bea Arthur’s dick!”</p>
            <p>At the Comedy Central roast of Justin Bieber in 2015, guest roaster Snoop Dogg dropped “nigga” on the bemused pop star no fewer than 19 times in a two-minute stretch—an achievement in button-pushing. But perhaps nobody has been hit as hard as conservative pundit Ann Coulter, who probably should have thought twice before agreeing to help roast Rob Lowe on Comedy Central in 2016. Host David Spade was just one of many taking jabs at Coulter: “She seems stiff and conservative, but Ann gets wild in the sheets—just ask the Klan.” </p>
            <p>No matter how pointed the barbs or how low the blows, at the end of the day, a roast is a roast. Everyone is fair game, and your only defense is a big laugh at your own expense.</p>

            <h2>Fanning the Flames</h2>

            <p>Roasts entered the mainstream—and became immensely popular—when Dean Martin added them to his weekly TV variety show in 1973. Sanitized and censored for television, these events poked fun at comedians, actors, and politicians, with jabs like this one from Don Rickles to Ronald Reagan: “Black, white, Jew, gentile, we’re all working for one cause: to figure out how you became governor.” </p>
            <p>After The Dean Martin Show was canceled in 1974, Martin began hosting a series of specials christened The Dean Martin Celebrity Roasts. Martin himself often led the charge, even taking aim at fellow roaster Don Rickles: “Don’s idea of a fun evening is to show home movies of the attack on Pearl Harbor—with a laugh track.” Over the course of a decade, Martin’s specials brought roasts to a wide audience and put a spotlight on the proud tradition, which quietly continued behind the doors of the Friars Club.</p>

            <h2>Ladies of the Roast</h2>

            <p>Although women weren’t officially admitted to the Friars Club until 1988, Lucille Ball joined the ranks of the roasted in 1961. After reminding the crowd to treat her like a lady, Johnny Carson introduced her as “Lucille Testicle.” Fed up with hearing the boys whisper about what went on inside the club, Phyllis Diller dressed up as a man and sneaked into Sid Caesar’s roast in 1983. Diller said afterward, “It was the funniest, dirtiest thing I ever heard in my life.”</p>
            <p>The Dean Martin Show was the first to roast a woman on television, airing a tribute to Bette Davis in 1973. Female comedians have also slung their share of put-downs. In 2010, veteran roaster Lisa Lampanelli—known as the “Queen of Mean”—razzed Baywatch star David Hasselhoff about his drinking: “[His] liver is so black, it’s fucking two of the Kardashian sisters.” </p>
            <p>Women don’t pull punches when lampooning other women either, as evidenced by Whitney Cummings’s roast of Joan Rivers: “Look at Joan. I’ve always wanted to know what Ivana Trump would look like if she was dating Chris Brown.” After being excluded for decades, women quickly demonstrated they could dish it out—and take it—as well as men.</p>

            <h1>History of Taboo</h1>
            <p>An old notion suggests that it’s impolite to discuss sex, religion, or politics at a dinner party. And for much of the history of American comedy, those same topics—and a few more—have been off-limits. Sometimes there were explicit bans and censorship; other times the taboos were unstated but understood. </p>
            <p>Of course, once something is deemed unacceptable, it becomes seductively enticing to comedians. Comics are constantly pushing the limits to see what they can get away with. Often they’ll use wordplay, innuendo, and satire to test out a topic, eventually addressing the most taboo of subjects directly, repeatedly, ferociously. </p>
            <p>Though sometimes the intent is simply to be shocking, many comedians believe boundary-breaking material serves a larger purpose. “Comedy puts light onto darkness,” says stand-up Sarah Silverman. “Darkness can’t live where there’s light. So that’s why it’s important to talk about things that are taboo. Otherwise they just stay in the dark and become dangerous.”</p>

            <h2>Vaudeville: The Sunday School Circuit</h2>
            <p>Early vaudeville arose to compete with burlesque, offering a clean alternative to the more vulgar entertainments that flourished after the Civil War. Benjamin Franklin Keith and his partner, Edward Albee, became the most successful and powerful vaudeville producers of the era, in part by merciless enforcement of prudish standards. “We believed in soap and water,” Albee once said, “and in strict censorship of the stage.”</p>
            <p>A backstage note to Keith-Albee performers said: “You are hereby warned that your act must be free from all vulgarity and suggestiveness in words, actions, and costumes.” The so-called Sunday School Circuit banned terms such as liar, slob, son-of-a-gun, and even pants—the acceptable term being trousers. Comedians who tried to sneak a risqué word or line into their act would receive a note, delivered in a blue envelope, telling them to cut the offending language. Off-color material would forever after be referred to as “blue.”</p>

            <h2>Prohibition: Goodness Had Nothing to Do with It</h2>
            <p>There was delicious irony in using the term <u>Prohibition</u> to describe an era that winked at many previously taboo behaviors. As urbanites began flocking to speakeasies and cabarets to circumvent the nationwide ban on alcohol, they also began flouting conventional mores and even developing a taste for camp. In the early 1930s, New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco reveled in the Pansy Craze. The smart set thronged to nightspots to enjoy bawdy songs and revues put on by drag queens and other gay performers, including Jean Malin, the acerbic, tuxedo-wearing star of New York’s Club Abbey. </p>
            <p>In 1927, Broadway actress Mae West wrote a play called <u>The Drag</u> about a closeted socialite. The comedy was banned after 10 performances, but West became a gay icon and continued to elevate innuendo to an art form. In the 1933 film <u>I’m No Angel</u>, she banters with Cary Grant, who tells her, “You were wonderful tonight.” West: “I’m always wonderful at night.” Grant: “Yes, but tonight you were especially good.” West: “When I’m good, I’m very good. But when I’m bad, I’m better.” </p>
            <p>That sort of sharp double-entendre dialogue drove the major studios to initiate strict enforcement of the Hays Code in 1934. The code banned nudity, ridicule of religion, and reference to sexual “perversion,” among many other things. It also proscribed words such as nuts (except when used to describe a crazy person), fanny, fairy, lousy, slut, and . . . pansy.</p>

            <h2>The Bawdy Politic</h2>
            <p>In many parts of the world, comedians who joke about their country’s leader get arrested. In the United States, they get laughs. Even the sainted Abraham Lincoln was savagely lampooned during his presidency. </p>
            <p>Hollywood films and early radio both had the ability to reach national audiences, which were likely to be divided on any political commentary. In 1936, NBC sent a memo to stations warning them to avoid references to a recent Supreme Court decision. “All comedians,” the memo declared more broadly, “must refrain from political comments.” Before the United States entered World War II, radio networks and movie studios sometimes blocked comic jabs at Adolf Hitler, afraid of riling the German Americans in their audiences.</p>
            <p>During the Red Scare of the late 1940s and ’50s, comic actors including Zero Mostel and Jack Gilford and writers such as Ring Lardner Jr. were barred from working in Hollywood because of their former affiliations with the Communist Party. “I am a man of a thousand faces,” Mostel said, “all of them blacklisted.” The FBI also kept tabs on stars such as Charlie Chaplin and Groucho Marx, thanks to their progressive political views. </p>
            <p>CBS took the Smothers Brothers’ hit variety show off the air in 1969 in no small part because of the outspoken pair’s antiwar politics. Years later, stand-up Bill Maher enraged many in the days immediately after 9/11. “We have been the cowards,” Maher said, “lobbing missiles from 2,000 miles away. Staying in the airplane when it hits the building—say what you want about it—not cowardly.” ABC canceled Maher’s show, which was aptly named <u>Politically Incorrect</u>.</p>

            <h2>Sick, Sick, Sick</h2>
            <p>In the mid-1950s, a new style of comedy emerged, marked by its conversational approach to social commentary and political satire. It delighted some and incensed others. Time famously called the trend “sick comedy,” saying, “They attack motherhood, childhood, adulthood, sainthood.” The magazine tagged Mort Sahl as “the original sicknik.” </p>
            <p>When Sahl first took the stage at San Francisco’s hungry i nightclub in 1953, he was something completely new. He worked with a rolled-up newspaper as his only prop and riffed on the headlines. “Every time the Russians throw an American in jail,” he observed, “the [House Un-American Activities] Committee throws an American in jail to get even.” </p>
            <p>If Sahl was the conscience of the New Wave comedians, Lenny Bruce was their unfettered id. He revolutionized stand-up by addressing the taboo subjects of religion, racism, and sex, and his routines typically featured words like shit, fuck, cocksucker, and—perhaps most shocking of all—nigger. “It’s the suppression of the word [nigger] that gives it the power, the violence, the viciousness,” Bruce said. His most radical contribution to comedy, however, may have been going onstage and simply talking about himself. </p>

            <h2>Fairy Tales</h2>
            <p>For decades, entertainment censors objected to anything that might suggest homosexuality. It wasn’t that they disliked the ridicule and gay-bashing that had flourished in burlesque comedy; they simply wanted to avoid any acknowledgment that gays and lesbians existed. One NBC censor complained in 1938 that many radio comedians, including Bob Hope, Jack Benny, and George Burns and Gracie Allen, relied on jokes about “effeminate gentlemen or sex-perverted characters.”</p>
            <p>Rae Bourbon, an openly gay female impersonator who rose to prominence in the 1930s and 1940s, released several comedy records that referenced homosexuality. Onstage he performed risqué material, singing songs such as “Mr. Wong Has Got the Biggest Tong in China” and getting arrested several times on charges of obscenity and “staging a lewd performance.”</p>
            <p>In the 1950s, Milton Berle frequently appeared in drag on his mainstream television show. Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon’s cross-dressing was also a central plot device in the 1959 movie <u>Some Like It Hot</u>, directed by Billy Wilder. United Artists released the film without a Motion Picture Production Code seal of approval, and its enormous success dealt a deathblow to the Hays Code.</p>
            <p>A 1994 episode of the TV show <u>Roseanne</u> featured the first same-sex kiss in sitcom history. When ABC finally agreed to broadcast the episode, it placed a parental advisory at the start. Three years later, stand-up Ellen DeGeneres had her character come out as gay on the sitcom <u>Ellen</u>. Televangelist Jerry Falwell called her “Ellen DeGenerate,” and the ABC affiliate in Birmingham, Alabama, refused to air the show. Nonetheless, the episode was watched by 42 million viewers.</p>

            <h2>Don’t Touch That Dial </h2>
            <p>To rule the local airwaves, a radio station usually had to win the morning drive-time slot. This meant stations and their top DJs, the shock jocks, were willing to do almost anything—prank phone calls, sex workers in the studio, outrageous stunts of all sorts. One DJ had a sidekick get a haircut on the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge, tying up rush-hour traffic for hours. Another castrated and then killed a wild boar in the studio parking lot. Two more promoted a contest for listeners to have sex in a public spot while a third person reported from the scene. </p>
            <p>Petey Greene, a Black DJ working in Washington, D.C., from 1966 to 1984, is most often cited as the first shock jock. One of Greene’s acolytes was a gangly young broadcaster named Howard Stern, who was smart, acid tongued, and seemingly without boundaries. Following the massacre at Columbine High School in 1999, Stern wondered on-air why the shooters hadn’t tried to have sex with “the really good-looking girls” who were fleeing in panic.  <u>The Howard Stern Show</u> was syndicated on terrestrial radio from 1986 to 2005 and, at its peak, aired in 60 markets in the United States and Canada. </p>
            <p>Oddly, perhaps, television helped end the heyday of the radio shock jock. After Janet Jackson’s much discussed nip slip at the 2004 Super Bowl, Congress passed the Broadcast Decency Enforcement Act, which increased fines for both TV and radio broadcasters nearly twentyfold. This effectively discouraged radio stations from going after the PR bump brought by provocative stunts and salty language. </p>

            <h2>Too Soon</h2>
            <p>In the wake of tragic events, modern comedians have grappled with a version of the question “When is it OK to start asking, ‘Besides that, Mrs. Lincoln, how’d you like the play?’ ” When are comics using laughter to help a wound heal, and when are they merely picking at a fresh scab? Debate still roils about whether the Holocaust, decades later, is now fair game for comics. (Some, including Joan Rivers and Sarah Silverman, have said emphatically that the time has arrived.)</p>
            <p>Eighteen days after terrorists flew planes into the Pentagon and the twin towers of the World Trade Center, comic Gilbert Gottfried told the audience at a Friars Club roast that he was flying to California after the event. “I can’t get a direct flight,” he riffed. “They said I have to stop at the Empire State Building first.” The audience jeered Gottfried and one member shouted, “Too soon!” The rebuke became a catchphrase for joking about a tragedy while the wound is still fresh. </p>
            <p>“The thing about a joke about the Holocaust, the AIDS crisis, 9/11,” says comedian Judy Gold, “it’s all about the funny. “It’s got to be funny. You can’t tell a crappy joke about the biggest tragedy in the world. You can’t do it.”</p>

            <h2>Oh, What a Tangled Web </h2>
            <p>The internet has been a boon for comedy, allowing performers and viewers to share everything from cat memes to presidential satire. With social media, cell phones, and viral videos, however, every set a comedian does—no matter how small the original venue—has the potential to become a global performance. And a stand-up’s single misstep can ignite a massive firestorm. </p>
            <p>In a culture of microaggressions and speech codes, comedians have faced shaming on social media and have even lost jobs when they’ve crossed the wrong lines. No longer the exclusive province of the government, organized religion, and corporate America, censorship is now crowd-sourced. Audience members, much like the egg-tossing patrons at Shakespeare’s Globe Theatre, can quickly turn against an errant comedian. </p>
            <p>Will these heightened sensibilities kill comedy? Not likely. The best comedians will continue to plumb the darkness, exposing hypocrisy and hard truths. “Comics shed light,” says comedian Scott Capurro. “We’re as necessary as a lightbulb, yet harder to replace.”</p>

            <h2>Sex: No Longer a Pregnant Pause</h2>
            <p>The Hays Code, which governed the tone and content of American movies for decades, had far more to say about sex than any other topic. It banned nudity, suggestive dancing, prostitution, and lustful kissing. For more than 20 years, married couples on-screen slept in separate beds. Men were required to keep their feet planted during screen kisses, which were not to last more than three seconds. This straitlaced approach also extended to radio, where censors cautioned comedians to avoid using phrases such as “pregnant pause.”</p>
            <p>When <u>I Love Lucy</u> star Lucille Ball became pregnant during the early days of television, the topic was written into the show and rolled out in an episode called “Lucy Is Enceinte.” The word pregnant was never used. In 1967, stand-up comic Joan Rivers made three appearances on <u>The Ed Sullivan Show</u> late in her pregnancy but was forbidden to talk about her condition.</p>
            <p>Fifty years later, a visibly pregnant Ali Wong joked about anal sex, among other topics, in her Netflix comedy special. While a sympathetic take on, say, rape or child molestation is still a ticket for trouble, comedians no longer need to tiptoe into the bedroom. These days they can swing from the chandeliers—and then post the video. </p>

            <h2>The Other Black Humor</h2>
            <p>Racism was fundamental to early American comedy. For much of the 19th century, minstrel shows dominated entertainment in the United States, with white performers wearing blackface and mocking people of African descent through music, dance, and demeaning comic sketches. Blackface proved so popular that many Black comedians of the vaudeville period also donned the distinctive makeup.</p>
            <p>Well into the 20th century, mainstream comedy was largely the domain of white comics. After World War II, as the country moved haltingly toward integration, comedy slowly added performers of color to the national laugh track. Even so, Black comedians found themselves under a constraint not imposed on their white counterparts: They weren’t allowed to target members of the audience. Comedian Slappy White was fired, albeit briefly, for violating this unwritten rule in Las Vegas during the 1950s. </p>
            <p>By the 1970s, that taboo was in shreds. More and more Black comedians were performing routines about race that were both brutally frank and painfully funny. Richard Pryor grabbed the forbidden n-word and, through relentless repetition, made it his trademark. In the mid-1970s he won three straight Grammy Awards for comedy records with provocative titles like That Nigger’s Crazy and Bicentennial Nigger. </p>
            <p>Latino comedians such as George Lopez and Asian American stand-ups including Margaret Cho have also succeeded in turning racism on its head. Cho, who has received multiple Grammy nominations for her comedy, was criticized in 2015 for an impersonation of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un at the Golden Globe Awards. “I’m not playing the race card,” she tweeted afterward. “I’m playing the rice card.”</p>

            <h2>I Swear It’s Funny</h2>
            <p>Vaudeville’s Keith-Albee circuit and Hollywood’s Hays Code had lists of banned words, but neither included the most obscene terms, which were presumably considered too vile to be written down. In 1949, comedian Lenny Ross was arrested in Atlantic City, New Jersey, for being “smutty.” He told the presiding judge, “I resort to smut only because patrons demand it.” </p>
            <p>Comedian Lenny Bruce changed the language of stand-up forever—and was hounded for his transgressions by vice squads and morality police in every city where he played. In 1966, Bruce listed the nine words for which he had been arrested: ass, balls, cocksucker, cunt, fuck, motherfucker, piss, shit, and tits. (He overlooked schmuck, a Yiddish word for penis that had led to his arrest in West Hollywood.) </p>
            <p>A few years later, George Carlin dropped ass and balls from Bruce’s list and developed a bit called “Seven Words You Can Never Say on Television.” The routine got Carlin arrested in Milwaukee in 1972 and later became the basis for a Supreme Court case that upheld the FCC’s authority to regulate indecency. </p>

            <h2>Religion: The Sacred Cow</h2>
            <p>Despite years of satirizing society’s biggest institutions—the government, the military, big business, academia—comedians in the first half of the 20th century still trod lightly around organized religion. The New Wave comics of the late 1950s, particularly Lenny Bruce, began throwing off such restraints. </p>
            <p>When Monty Python released the 1979 film <u>Life of Brian</u>, a mild biblical satire, Christian and Jewish groups alike took offense. Protests led to screenings being cancelled in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and Charlotte, North Carolina. In the United Kingdom, numerous towns—including at least one with no cinema—banned the movie, as did Ireland and Norway. (In Sweden, <u>Life of Brian</u> was touted as “So funny, it was banned in Norway.”)</p>
            <p>Religion is still considered a touchy subject, and comics ranging from Bill Hicks to Kathy Griffin have had bits on Jesus and Christianity excised from shows. But no one, with the possible exception of George Carlin, has gone after religion as relentlessly as <u>South Park</u>. The animated series has poked fun at Jesus, Catholics, Buddhists, Scientologists, and Mormons.</p>
            <p>In 2006, Comedy Central censored part of a <u>South Park</u> episode that included images of the prophet Muhammad. The decision may have been providential: Nine years later, the French weekly <u>Charlie Hebdo</u> was attacked by terrorists who killed a dozen people, including a number of prominent cartoonists, for satirizing Islam and publishing cartoon images of Muhammad.</p>

            <h2>Cable Comedy: That’s Some Good Shit</h2>
            <p>The 1970s saw the rise of the first national pay-television cable networks, which in turn created an enormous need for new content. For its first comedy special in late 1975, Home Box Office enticed Second City veteran Robert Klein with the come-on “And you can say anything you want.” Two years later, a George Carlin special put that promise to the test, warning viewers that the show included “language you hear every day on the street, though rarely on TV.”</p>
            <p>In 1983, when he was 22 and already a huge star, Eddie Murphy recorded a concert film called <u>Delirious</u> for HBO. The comedian’s send-ups of James Brown, Elvis, and Michael Jackson became legend, as did his profanity. Murphy says “fuck” 231 times and “shit” 186 times during the course of the 70-minute film.</p>
            <p>Other cable comics would perform routines that were lewder and lewder, leading Murphy to later tell <u>Rolling Stone</u>, “I’m feeling like a fucking old guy watching Sam Kinison and Andrew Dice Clay.”</p>

            <p><u>Playboy</u> had a lofty mission when it launched: to challenge to 1950s social mores and sexual taboos. Cartoons were central to Playboy’s cause, and the publication quickly attracted top illustrators, who enjoyed broad artistic freedom.</p>

            <p><u>National Lampoon</u> was known for parodying other publications—and the readers who consumed them. P.J. O’Rourke combined puerile humor with sexual imagery for this 1973 insert, which imagined a kiddie version of the era’s porn tabloids.

            <h2><u>Pearl Williams: A Trip Around the World Is Not a Cruise</u>, early 1960s</h2>

            <p>Williams was nothing if not risqué in the 1960s. A comedian and singer known for performing “venereal material,” she filled her act with language that, at the time, was considered foul. Her material was so X-rated, record stores kept her albums behind the counter.</p>

            <p>Rock’s stand-up routines were chock full of profanity, yet his foul language wasn’t a shortcut to laughs. He used obscenities to fan the flames during his performances, which often included impassioned critiques of everything from racism to sexual politics. </p>

            <h2>Andrew Dice Clay,<u> One Night with Dice</u>, 1987 </h2>

            <p>In the late 1980s, Andrew Dice Clay was one of the kings of dirty stand-up. His routines, performed in character as an attitude-heavy wise guy, often featured obscene parodies of nursery rhymes.</p>

            <hr>

            <h2>R. Crumb, “All Meat Comics,” 1969</h2>

            <p>Robert Crumb’s surreal illustrations defied mainstream taste, often capturing human flesh in moments of ecstasy, perversion, or agony. Though he endured heavy criticism throughout the decades, Crumb ultimately earned respect as a serious visual artist.  </p>

            <p>Foxx’s “party records,” which sold in the millions in the 1950s, featured uncensored sexual humor, and cemented Foxx’s reputation as one of America’s premiere bawdy comedians.</p>

            <h2>Chelsea Handler, <u>Comedy Central Presents: “Chelsea Handler,”</u> 2007</h2>

            <p>A stand-up comic and talk-show host, Handler often found humor in sex and booze. Her riffs on blue topics like masturbation made her a national star—and helped propel her career as a bestselling author. </p>

            <p>While in jail, Lenny Bruce wrote this deeply personal letter to his father. It begins with an allegory about the relationship between fathers and sons, and concludes with a call for support.</p>

            <p>Widely regarded as "The Mother of the Sexual Revolution," Rusty Warren developed a unique brand of raw and empowered comedy that involved speaking out for sexual liberation and gender equality. Although here "party records" sold more than 5,000,000 copies and garnered seven Gold Records, Rusty Warren's work was denied radio airplay and she was banned from appearing on mainstream television at the height of her fame.</p>

            <p>In describing her stage persona, Rusty Warren explained: "She couldn't be vulnerable to the people in the audience who would misunderstand it as feminine stupidity. Rusty wasn't stupid. Rusty was sharp. Rusty had a big mouth. Rusty said to the men what the wives wanted to say...but couldn't."</p>

            <p>In 1960, Rusty Warren's most influential album <u>Knockers Up!</u> fueled the fires of the Women's Liberation Movement and became an immediate bestseller, with over one million registered members of Jubilee Records' "Knockers Up Club." In The album, Rusty explained: "I have said that man was born to thrust upon us the biggest and best they have. I feel that it is our turn now to rise and unite and thrust back at them, with the biggest and best we have. [...] Throw your shoulders back, get your knockers up and put a big smile on your face. Knockers up, everybody!"</p>

            <p class="ad">As you complete your visit, you enter into the historic Jamestown Train Station Grand Concourse. This houses our gift shop now, but originally served as the waiting area for passengers arrive and leaving Jamestown from the 1860s to 1970s. Italian green marble and white tiles cover the walls. Art deco light fixtures hang on the wall, with complimenting chandeliers hanging from the ceiling. Natural light fills the space through two large arched windows on the upper part of the side vaulted ceiling. Restored original bench can be found throughout the waiting area.</p>

            <p> Thank You for visiting the National Comedy Center. We hope you have enjoyed exploring the story of comedy.</p>
